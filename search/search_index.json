The workshop can be used to support two distinct agendas, or you can mix and match, as all of the hands-on labs are supported on a single Lab environment. Liberty (up to 5 hours) Application Modernization Tools (up to 5 hours) Workshop Objectives: Learn basic Liberty concepts, archive installation, and working with Liberty in various development environments and containers Learn how to use Mono2Micro to create partitioned services from WebSphere monolith applications Learn how to use Transformation Advisor to assess WebSphere Applications for moving to container-based clouds At the end of this workshop, the attendee will learn how to install Liberty, understand Liberty concepts, use Liberty in common IDE\u2019s, Dev Mode, in containers, and from the command line. Attendees get hands-on experience using Mono2Micro from end-to-end, including code generation and deployment of the new partitioned services in Liberty running in containers. Attendees also gain experience using Transformation Advisor during the Java application assessment phase of application modernization journey to Liberty and container-based clouds. This course is geared toward developers and architects who are seeking to understand fundamentals of working with Liberty, Mono2Micro, and Transformation Advisor tools for modernizing traditional WebSphere applications. This is a hands-on workshop that contains the following exercises: Liberty archive installation and setup Getting started with Liberty with Liberty Tools in Eclipse IDE, and command line Using Liberty in Dev Mode via command line Using Liberty Tools in VS Code IDE Using Mono2Micro to create partition services from a WebSphere monolith application Using Transformation Advisor to assess WebSphere applications and deployig to Liberty and containers Reserve lab environments Please follow the reserve environment instructions to reserve a lab environment, or schedule a workshop.

Under the Scheduling Information page, there are advanced settings that further shape when the environments should be deployed, removed, and grow. These advanced settings are optional. The workshop scheduler has default values for deploying and removing environments based on the workshop start / end times that you setup. Auto Stop Limit: This field specifies how long an environment must be idle before it either shuts down or suspends the environment. The default time is 180 minutes. Auto Stop Behavior: This field determines the action to take when an environment is idle for the duration specified in the Auto Stop Limit field. TIP: When the environment includes Redhat OpenShift, ALWAYS specify SHUTDOWN. OpenShift cannot routinely be resumed from a suspended state. Deploy On: This field can be used to specify the date and time for the scheduler to start deploying the environments. TIP: Specify approximately 2 hours prior to your workshop to provide sufficient time for the environments to start. Remove On: This field can be used to specify the date and time for the scheduler to remove the environments. TIP: Specify approximately 1 hour after your workshop is scheduled to end. Enable Auto Grow: Use this field to specify that you want the number of environments to increase if you reach the maximum number of environments that were deployed. The default value is NO Auto grow step size: When auto grow is triggered this filed determines how many environment should be added at a time. The default value is 1 . Auto grow max: Specify the maximum number of environments allowed. Example: If you specified 20 environments, and you want to be able to add 5 additional environments, then this value should be set to 25.

Open Liberty supports the full MicroProfile and Jakarta EE APIs and is composable, meaning that you can use only the features that you need, keeping the server lightweight, which is great for microservices. It also deploys to every major cloud platform, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. Maven is an automation build tool that provides an efficient way to develop Java applications. Using Maven, you will build a simple microservice, called system , that collects basic system properties from your laptop and displays them on an endpoint that you can access in your web browser. Open Liberty development mode , or dev mode, allows you to develop applications with any text editor or IDE by providing hot reload and deployment, on demand testing, and debugger support. Open Liberty Dev Mode is enabled through Maven and Gradle projects. Your code is automatically compiled and deployed to your running server, making it easy to iterate on your changes. You can run tests on demand or even automatically so that you can get immediate feedback on your changes. You can also attach a debugger at any time to debug your running application. The lab environment One (1) Linux VM has been provided for this lab. The \u201cLiberty vPOT \u2026 Desktop\u201d VM has the following software available: Application Project with Liberty Maven 3.6.0 The login credentials for the Liberty vPOT \u2026 Desktop\u201d VM are: User ID: ibmdemo Password: passw0rd (That is a numeric zero in passw0rd) Login to the \"Liberty vPOT \u2026 Desktop\" VM and Get Started If the VM is not already started, start it by clicking the Play button.

From the Skytap menu bar, click on the \u201c Fit to Size \u201d icon. This will enlarge the viewing area to fit the size of your browser window. If, at aytime during the lab, you ar asked to install updates, click CANCEL! Important: Click CANCEL \u2026. If, at any time during the lab, you get a pop-up asking to install updated software onto the Ubuntu VM. The one we experience is an update available for VS Code. CLICK CANCEL! Getting Started with Liberty and Dev Mode In this lab, you will learn how to run and update a simple REST microservice on an Open Liberty server using the developer mode (dev mode). You will use Maven throughout the guide to build and run the microservice as well as to interact with the running server instance. Building and running the application using Maven and the liberty-maven-plugin The sample application used in this lab is configured to be built with Maven. Every Maven-configured project contains a pom.xml file, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, plug-ins, and so on. Your pom.xml file is located in the root directory of the project and is configured to include the liberty-maven-plugin, which allows you to install applications into Open Liberty and manage the server instances. To begin, navigate to the project directory. Build the \u201c system\u201d microservice that is provided and deploy it to Open Liberty by running the Maven liberty:run goal: Navigate to the project directory. Build the \u201c system\u201d microservice that is provided and deploy it to Open Liberty by running the Maven liberty:run goal: a. Open a terminal window and change to the directory /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project b. Run the mvn libert:run command to start the Liberty server mvn liberty:run The mvn command initiates a Maven build , during which the target directory is created to store all build-related files. The liberty:run argument specifies the Open Liberty run goal,which starts an Open Liberty server instance in the foreground. As part of this phase, an Open Liberty server runtime is downloaded and installed into the target/liberty/wlp directory, a server instance is created and configured in the target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer directory, and the application is installed into that server. When the server begins starting up, various messages display in your command-line session. Wait for the following message, which indicates that the server startup is complete: The server defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet. Access the \u201csystem\u201d microservice that was deployed to the Liberty server. a. Open the Firefox Web Browser from inside of the VM and go to the URL below. The microservice lists various system properties of your JVM. http://localhost:9080/system/properties Stop the Liberty Server by pressing the CTRL+C in the command-line session where you ran the server. Start and Stop the Liberty server in the background Although you can start and stop the server in the foreground by using the Maven liberty:run goal, you can also start and stop the server in the background with the Maven liberty:start and liberty:stop goals: mvn liberty:start mvn liberty:stop View the pom.xml file to see the liberty-maven-plugin that was > used by the previous steps. a. From a Terminal window, navigate to the following directory cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project b. View the relevant plugin in the pom.xml file. The -A and -B options on the grep command display the specified number of lines before and after the location of the search text string. cat pom.xml | grep -B 4 -A 2 liberty-maven-plugin Information: Tip: Additional information on the liberty-maven-plugin can be found here: https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven Updating the application without restarting the server The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a dev goal that listens for any changes in the project, including application source code or configuration changes. The Open Liberty server automatically reloads the application and configuration without restarting. This goal allows for quicker turnarounds and an improved developer experience. Start the Liberty server in \u201cdev\u201d mode a. From a Terminal window, navigate to the following directory cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project b. Ensure the Liberty server is STOPPED! mvn liberty:stop c. Start Liberty in dev mode mvn liberty:dev Note: The Liberty is now started in dev mode. Dev mode automatically picks up changes that you make to your application and allows you to run tests by pressing the enter/return key in the active command-line session. When you\u2019re working on your application, rather than rerunning Maven commands, press the enter/return key to verify your change, which executes your tests. Access the \u201csystem\u201d microservice that was deployed to the Liberty server. a. Open the Firefox Web Browser from inside of the VM and go to the URL below to display the main application web page http://localhost:9080/ Make a minor change to the \u201csystem Properties Sample\u201d source code while running in dev mode, to see the changes dynamically picked up and applied to the running server. a. Open a new terminal window and navigate to src/main/webapp folder of the application as illustrated below. cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project/src/main/webapp b. Use the gedit editor to open the index.html file in edit mode gedit index.html c. Make the following minor change to the index.html page Change the highlighted line: Updated to read: System Properties Demo d. Save the file and close the gedit editor. Access the System Properties Sample microservice that was deployed to the Liberty server. a. From the Firefox Web Browser inside of the VM and go to the URL below to display the main application web page http://localhost:9080/ b. IMPORTANT : Click the RELOAD icon in the Firefox browser to reload the page. Browsers cache content, so you need to reload the page. c. The updated index.html page is displayed with your changes dynamically picked up The application code changes were detected and dynamically applied to the running instance of the Liberty server. Updating the Server configuration without restarting the server The Open Liberty Maven plug-in\u2019s dev goal not only listens for application code changes, but also configuration changes in the project. The Open Liberty server automatically reloads the configuration without restarting. This goal allows for quicker turnarounds and an improved developer experience. In this section, you make a simple configuration change in the Liberty Server configuration file (server.xml) of the project (src), to include a /health endpoint for the service. You will notice that the changes are detected by maven and dynamically updated on the target server.xml. The running Liberty instance automatically picks up the changed target configuration If you try to access this /health endpoint now, you see a 404 error because the /health endpoint does not yet exist: From the Firefox browser in the VM, try to access the applications /health endpoint at: <http://localhost:9080/health/> Make a simple change to the Liberty Server configuration file to add the mpHealth-2.2 feature to the server.xml file, which enables the health check endpoint. a From a terminal window, navigate to liberty/config folder of the application cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project/src/main/liberty/config b. Use the gedit editor to open the server.xml file in edit mode gedit server.xml c. Add the Make the following minor change to the server.xml file Change the highlighted line: Updated to include: \\<feature>mpHealth-2.2\\</feature> d. Save the file and close the gedit editor. Access the new Health Endpoint for the application. a. Open the Firefox Web Browser from inside of the VM and go to the URL below to display the health endpoint. http://localhost:9080/health View the Liberty server console log to see the mpHealth-2.2 feature was installed, and the health endpoint enabled. a. Return to the Terminal window where the mvn liberty:dev is running. b. Review the messages that indicate the mpHealth-22 feature was dynamically installed and the /health endpoint enabled. The Liberty server configuration changes were detected and dynamically applied to the running instance of the Liberty server. The /health endpoint reports whether the server is running, but the endpoint doesn\u2019t provide any details on the microservices that are running inside of the server. MicroProfile Health offers health checks for both readiness and liveness. A readiness check allows third-party services, such as Kubernetes, to know if the microservice is ready to process requests. A liveness check allows third-party services to determine if the microservice is running. Note: Working with MicroProfile Health is beyond the scope of this lab and is introduced in a subsequent lab. Developing and Running the application in a Docker Container and in Liberty Dev Mode When developing an application that will eventually be deployed to production in containers , you can avoid potential issues by ensuring that your development and production environments are as similar as possible. This aligns with Twelve Factor App methodology, particularly factor 10, which calls for dev/prod parity. For cloud-native applications, part of this issue is addressed by using containers where your environment can be codified to provide consistency between development and production. In this section of the lab, you will use Liberty dev mode with containers . With container support, you can develop applications on your local environment while your Open Liberty server runs in a container. The development container image is kept as similar as possible to the production container image, while still allowing for iterative development. Your code changes are automatically hot deployed to the container and picked up by the running server. Additionally, dev mode allows you run tests either automatically or on demand, and you can attach a debugger at any time to debug your application. With container support for Open Liberty dev mode, you can use the same Dockerfile for both development and production. You use the same base image and customizations, and you specify the exact configuration files that you need for your application in your Dockerfile. This prevents you from running into any surprises when you deploy your application to production. Dev mode changes how the image is built and run to enable iterative development, so the images are identical except for how application and configuration files are mounted into the containers. With dev mode, simply save a source file in any text editor or IDE, and it is recompiled and picked up without any need to rebuild the image or restart the server. Investigate Docker Commands and Dockerfile for building images This section is a primer on how to use, build, deploy and run Liberty in a Docker container. You will pull Liberty from Docker hub, install it, review information about the container, access resources inside the container, add an application then test it. To run the application in a container, Docker needs to be installed and the Docker daemon running. In this lab environment, these prerequisites have been configured. Open a Terminal window and verify that Docker is running docker --version Run the hello-world docker sample. The docker image will be pulled from Dockerhub if it is not already on the local machine. If Docker is functioning properly, you will see the highlighted message illustrated below, stating that Docker is working properly. docker run --name hello-world hello-world | Use the docker images command to find out which Docker images are in the local docker repository docker images Use the docker history command to view the layers that make up the Docker image docker history hello-world Let\u2019s run a Liberty image Docker container. Docker will check if there is an image in the repository. If not, it will download the latest image, then run it docker run -d -p 9086:9080 --name wlp websphere-liberty Review the containers information. a. The docker ps command lists only running containers. The docker ps -a command shows all containers, running or stopped. docker ps b. The docker stats command shows resource usage of the running containers. Use the Ctrl + C keys to stop stats docker stats Open the Firefox browser on the VM and access Liberty running in the container: http://localhost:9086 Look at the Liberty logs in the running container docker logs -f wlp Stop and remove the docker containers used in this section of the lab. Then use the docker ps -a command to verify the containers are removed. docker stop wlp docker rm wlp</p> docker rm hello-world</p> docker ps -a</p></td> Running the application in a container To run the application in a container, Docker needs to be installed and the Docker daemon running. In this lab environment, these prerequisites have been configured. First, to containerize the application, you need a Dockerfile . This file contains a collection of instructions that define how a Docker image is built, what files are packaged into it, what commands run when the image runs as a container, and other information. For this lab, a Dockerfile has been provided to build the docker image for the System Properties Sample. This Dockerfile copies the .war file into a Docker image that contains the Java runtime and a preconfigured Open Liberty server. From a Terminal window, STOP the running Liberty Server from the previous section of the lab, using the commands below: cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project mvn liberty:stop View the Dockerfile that is used to build the docker image. a. Open a terminal window and change to the directory: /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project b. Investigate the Dockerfile cat Dockerfile | The Dockerfile performs the following tasks: Read below for a short description and details of the commands in the Dockerfile: FROM openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi FROM specifies the Docker image that is to be used. If this is not in the local repository, this will be pulled from Docker Hub. In this example, we pull the liberty kernel image that contains Java 8, and uses the RedHat Universal base Images for deployments to OpenShift. The kernel image contains just the Liberty kernel and no additional runtime features. This image is the recommended basis for custom built images, so that they can contain only the features required for a specific application ARG VERSION=1.0 and ARG REVISION=SNAPSHOT The ARG instruction defines variables that can be passe at build time. Once it is defined in the Dockerfile, you can pass it with the flag --build-arg . LABEL Labels are used in Dockerfile to help organize your Docker Images. Labels are key-value pairs and simply adds custom metadata to your Docker Images. COPY --chown=1001:0 src/main/liberty/config/ /config/ The COPY command copies the liberty configuration file (server.xml) to the /config folder in the Liberty container. The RedHat Universal Base Images (UBI) are built such that Liberty does not run as root. To ensure that Liberty can access the files that are copied to the image, they must be owned by a non-root user. All Liberty images from IBM contain a non- root user defined as 1001:0 . So the copy command copies the files as the non-root user that is known to exist on the LIBERTY image. COPY --chown=1001:0 target/*.war /config/apps/ The COPY command copies the application WAR file to the /config/apps directory on the image. RUN configure.sh The configure.sh script installs the required Liberty features based on the features defined in the server configuration file (server.xml). This script is baked into ALL Liberty and tWAS Docker images provided by IBM. Run the mvn package command from the demo-project directory. The command will produce a war file named \" guide-getting-started.war \u201d and copied to the \u201c target \u201d directory. mvn package The Maven package command builds the application and produces an application deployable binary \u201c.war\u201d file that is copied into the Docker image via the Dockerfile. Run the following command to download or update to the latest Open iberty Docker image used in our Dockerfile: docker pull openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi Note: The image has already been pulled onto this VM. So, you may only see a message indicating the image is already up to date, rather than pulling the image again. OR, you might see this message if the latest image is already pulled. To build and containerize the application, run the following Docker build command. Be sure you are in the directory that contains the Docker file. Note: The dot at the end of the docker build command is part of the command, indicating to use the current directory path. cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project docker build -t openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT . The Docker openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT image is built from the Dockerfile . To verify that the image is built, run the docker images command to list all local Docker images docker images Your image should be listed as \u201c openliberty-getting-started \u201d with the TAG of \u201c 1.0-SNAPSHOT \u201d Next, run the container from the image. docker run -d --name gettingstarted-app -p 9080:9080 openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT There is a bit going on in that command; so, here is a short description of the parameters on the command. And the final argument on the command is the Docker image name. Run the docker ps command to verify your docker container is running docker ps From a Web Browser, access the application using: http://localhost:9080/system/properties Stop and Remove the Docker container docker stop gettingstarted-app docker rm gettingstarted-app Remove the Docker image docker rmi openliberty-getting-started:1.0-SNAPSHOT Using Dev mode to develop an application in a Docker container The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a devc goal that simplifies developing your application in a Docker container by starting dev mode with container support. This devc goal builds a Docker image, mounts the required directories, binds the required ports, and then runs the application inside of a container. Dev mode also listens for any changes in the application source code or configuration and rebuilds the image and restarts the container as necessary. Build and run the container by running the devc goal from the start directory: mvn liberty:devc a. When you see the massage: \u201c liberty is running in dev mode \u201d, Open Liberty is ready to run in dev mode: Open another Terminal window and run the docker ps command to verify that the container is started. docker ps From a Web Browser, access the application using: http://localhost:9080/system/properties Dev mode automatically picks up changes that you make to your application and allows you to run tests by pressing the enter/return key in the active command-line session. Run the integration test that is included in the application project. Note: The test case simply creates a client and invokes the http://localhost:9080/sste/properties endpoint. The expected HTTP response code is 200, which indicates a successful http response from the system/properties service. The test case will fail if the response code is anything other than 200. a. From the Terminal window that the mvn liberty:devc is running, press the ENTER key to run the tests. You will see that the test runs with no failures, as illustrated below. IMPORTANT: Next, you will introduce a change to the system/properties endpoint, which will break the test. In this lab, you will not go into detail on the test cases themselves because you will explore testing in greater detail in a subsequent lab when working with Liberty dev mode in the VS Code IDE. Update the server.xml file to change the context root from / to /dev a. From a terminal window, navigate to the liberty config folder of the application cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project/src/main/liberty/config b. Use the gedit editor to open the index.html file in edit mode gedit server.xml c. Make the following minor change to the index.html page Change the highlighted line: Updated to read: contextRoot=\u201d/ dev \u201d /> d. Save the file and close the gedit editor. After you SAVE the file changes, Open Liberty automatically reloads its configuration. You can access the application at: http://localhost:9080/dev/system/properties Notice that context root is now /dev IMPORTANT: We encountered situations where the container got mapped to Docker host port 9081 instead of 9080. This happens when the new container comes up before the old container ports have been freed. To get the container back to port 9080, devc or do a minor change to the server.xml.. Rerun the integration test that is included in the application roject. a. From the Terminal window that the mvn liberty:devc is running, press the ENTER key to run the tests. You will see that the test runs, but now FAILS because a 404 HTTP response code was returned, using the original context root. Note: For the test case to PASS , the test case itself would need to be updated to reflect invoking the system/properties service using the new /dev context root. This activity is beyond the scope of this lab. However, you will explore the tests in greater detail in a subsequent lab. Lab cleanup and completion Exit Liberty devc mode a. When you are finished, exit dev mode by pressing CTRL+C in the command-line session that the container was started from, or by typing q and then pressing the enter/return key. Note: Either of these options stops and removes the container. b. To check that the container was stopped, run the docker ps command. docker ps Congratulations ! You have successfully completed the lab \u201cGetting Started with Liberty and Dev Mode.

This aligns with Twelve Factor App methodology, particularly factor 10, which calls for dev/prod parity. For cloud-native applications, part of this issue is addressed by using containers where your environment can be codified to provide consistency between development and production. In this section of the lab, you will use Liberty dev mode with containers . With container support, you can develop applications on your local environment while your Open Liberty server runs in a container. The development container image is kept as similar as possible to the production container image, while still allowing for iterative development. Your code changes are automatically hot deployed to the container and picked up by the running server. Additionally, dev mode allows you run tests either automatically or on demand, and you can attach a debugger at any time to debug your application. With container support for Open Liberty dev mode, you can use the same Dockerfile for both development and production. You use the same base image and customizations, and you specify the exact configuration files that you need for your application in your Dockerfile. This prevents you from running into any surprises when you deploy your application to production. Dev mode changes how the image is built and run to enable iterative development, so the images are identical except for how application and configuration files are mounted into the containers. With dev mode, simply save a source file in any text editor or IDE, and it is recompiled and picked up without any need to rebuild the image or restart the server.","title":"Developing and Running the application in a Docker Container and in Liberty Dev Mode"},{"location":"lab-guides/md/lab3/Lab03-Liberty_devmode_v1.4/#investigate-docker-commands-and-dockerfile-for-building-images","text":"This section is a primer on how to use, build, deploy and run Liberty in a Docker container.

In this lab environment, these prerequisites have been configured. First, to containerize the application, you need a Dockerfile . This file contains a collection of instructions that define how a Docker image is built, what files are packaged into it, what commands run when the image runs as a container, and other information. For this lab, a Dockerfile has been provided to build the docker image for the System Properties Sample. This Dockerfile copies the .war file into a Docker image that contains the Java runtime and a preconfigured Open Liberty server. From a Terminal window, STOP the running Liberty Server from the previous section of the lab, using the commands below: cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project mvn liberty:stop View the Dockerfile that is used to build the docker image. a. Open a terminal window and change to the directory: /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project cd /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/demo-project b. Investigate the Dockerfile cat Dockerfile | The Dockerfile performs the following tasks: Read below for a short description and details of the commands in the Dockerfile: FROM openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi FROM specifies the Docker image that is to be used. If this is not in the local repository, this will be pulled from Docker Hub. In this example, we pull the liberty kernel image that contains Java 8, and uses the RedHat Universal base Images for deployments to OpenShift. The kernel image contains just the Liberty kernel and no additional runtime features. This image is the recommended basis for custom built images, so that they can contain only the features required for a specific application ARG VERSION=1.0 and ARG REVISION=SNAPSHOT The ARG instruction defines variables that can be passe at build time. Once it is defined in the Dockerfile, you can pass it with the flag --build-arg . LABEL Labels are used in Dockerfile to help organize your Docker Images. Labels are key-value pairs and simply adds custom metadata to your Docker Images. COPY --chown=1001:0 src/main/liberty/config/ /config/ The COPY command copies the liberty configuration file (server.xml) to the /config folder in the Liberty container. The RedHat Universal Base Images (UBI) are built such that Liberty does not run as root. To ensure that Liberty can access the files that are copied to the image, they must be owned by a non-root user. All Liberty images from IBM contain a non- root user defined as 1001:0 . So the copy command copies the files as the non-root user that is known to exist on the LIBERTY image. COPY --chown=1001:0 target/*.war /config/apps/ The COPY command copies the application WAR file to the /config/apps directory on the image. RUN configure.sh The configure.sh script installs the required Liberty features based on the features defined in the server configuration file (server.xml). This script is baked into ALL Liberty and tWAS Docker images provided by IBM. Run the mvn package command from the demo-project directory. The command will produce a war file named \" guide-getting-started.war \u201d and copied to the \u201c target \u201d directory. mvn package The Maven package command builds the application and produces an application deployable binary \u201c.war\u201d file that is copied into the Docker image via the Dockerfile. Run the following command to download or update to the latest Open iberty Docker image used in our Dockerfile: docker pull openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi Note: The image has already been pulled onto this VM. So, you may only see a message indicating the image is already up to date, rather than pulling the image again. OR, you might see this message if the latest image is already pulled. To build and containerize the application, run the following Docker build command. Be sure you are in the directory that contains the Docker file.

Getting Started with Open Liberty Tools in VS Code Liberty Dev mode allows you, as the developer, to focus on your code. When Open Liberty is running in dev mode, your code is automatically compiled and deployed to the running server, making it easy to iterate on your changes. In this lab, as a developer, you will experience using the Open Liberty Tools extension in VS Code to work with your code, run tests on demand, so that you can get immediate feedback on your changes. You will also work with integrated debugging tools and attach a Java debugger to debug your running application. From a developer perspective, this is a huge gain in efficiency, as all these iterative inner-loop development activities occur without ever leaving the integrated development environment (IDE). Review the VS Code extensions and projects pom.xm file used for this project The sample application used in this lab is configured to be built with Maven. Every Maven-configured project contains a pom.xml file, which defines the project configuration, dependencies, plug-ins, and so on. Your pom.xml file is in the root directory of the project and is configured to include the liberty-maven-plugin , which allows you to install applications into Open Liberty and manage the server instances. To begin, navigate to the project directory and review the IDE extensions and pom.xml file that is used for the \u201c system\u201d microservice that is provided in the lab. First, add the project folder to a VS Code Workspace Close all Terminal windows and Brower Tabs used in any previous lab.

Close the pom.xml file Information: Tip: Additional information on the liberty-maven-plugin can be found here: https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven Using Open Liberty Tools in VS Code In this section of the lab, you will use the Open Liberty Tools i n VS Code to work with your code and run tests on demand, so that you can get immediate feedback on your changes. Important: For Open Liberty Tools (LIBERTY DEV DASHBOARD) VS Code provides extensions for Java to support the Java language features. VS Code for Java supports two modes. Lightweight mode Standard mode VS Code has a default configuration called \u201chybrid mode\u201d where a workspace is opened in Lightweight mode, but as needed, you are prompted to switch to Standard mode. The Tools for MicroProfile Extension, which is required for the Open Liberty Tools extension, requires the Java workspace to be opened in \u201c STANDARD \u201d mode. Otherwise the LIBERTY DEV DASHBOARD will not function properly. Tip: In this lab environment, the workspace is already configured to use Standard mode. For more details on VS Code for Java is available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-project Use the Liberty Dev Dashboard to start the Liberty Server in dev mode a. In VS Code, expand the LIBERTY DEV DASHBOARD section b. Right-mouse click on the guide-getting-started Liberty Server c. Select Start from the menu to start the server d. The Terminal view opens, and you see the server log messages as the server starts. When the following message spear in the Terminal, the Liberty server is started. Run the system Properties sample application from a web browser a. Open the Firefox Browser from inside of the VM b. Go to http://localhost:9080 to verify the application is running. Developer experience Using Open Liberty Tools in VS Code The System Properties Sample application is up and running in the Liberty server. Next, as a developer, you want to implement a health check for the application. The developer experience is frictionless, as all code and configuration change the developer introduces, are automatically detected and the server and application are dynamically updated in the running server to reflect the updated code and configuration. Let\u2019s explore a couple of examples of the very efficient developer experience by implementing some new capability into our service. In this example, you will leverage the mpHealth-2.2 feature in Open Liberty, which implements the MicroProfile mpHealth-2.2 API, to implement the new health checks for the application. The mpHealth-2.2 feature provides a /health endpoint that represents a binary status, either UP or DOWN, of the microservices that are installed. To learn more about the MicroProfile mpHealth feature, visit: https://www.openliberty.io/docs/21.0.0.4/health-check-microservices.html Update the Liberty server configuration file (server.xml) to include the mpHealth-2.2 feature to begin implementing the health checks for the application. a. In the VS Code Explorer view, navigate to START -> src -> main -> liberty / config b. Click on server.xml to open the file in the editor pane c. Add the mpHealth-2.2 feature to the server.xml file using the text below: <feature\\>mpHealth-2.2\\</feature\\> d. Save and Close the server.xml file When the server.xml file is saved, the configuration changes are detected, and the server is dynamically updated, installing the new feature and updating the application in the running server. View the messages in the Terminal view, showing the feature being installed and the application being updated. Once the changes are saved, and the server is automatically updated, the new / health endpoint is available. From the Firefox browser in the VM access the /health endpoint to view the health status of the application. **http://localhost:9080/health** Currently, the basic health check provides a simple status indicating if the service is running, but not if it is healthy. In the next steps, you will implement a liveness check that implements logic that gathers memory and cpu usage information and reports the service DOWN in the health check if the system resources exceed a certain threshold. You will also implement a readiness check that checks external property configuration in the server.xml file, that is used to place the service in maintenance mode. And if the service is in maintenance mode, the service is marked DOWN from the health check. Copy an implementation of the SystemReadinessCheck.java to the project a. Open a Terminal window on the VM b. Run the following command to copy the SystemReadinessCheck.java to the project cp /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/guide-getting-started/finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemReadinessCheck.java /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/guide-getting-started/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemReadinessCheck.java < Information: For the purposes of the lab, the copy command above copies a fully implemented Readiness check from the \u201cfinished\u201d project, into the current working project. Review the SystemReadinessCheck.java i mplementation a. Return to the VS Code Explorer view b. Navigate to START > main > java / io / openliberty / sample / system c. Click on the SystemReadinessCheck.java file to open it in the editor pane The SystemReadinessCheck simply evaluates the \u201cinMaintenance \u201d ConfigProperty, which is implemented via the mpConfig MicroProfile feature, and configured in the Liberty Server\u2019s server.xml file. If the \u201cinMaintenance\u201d property is set to \u201c false \u201d the readiness check sets the Health Status to UP . If the inMaintenance property is set to \u201c true \u201d the status is set to DOWN . From the Firefox Browser in the VM, rerun the /health endpoint to view the health status of the application. http://localhost:9080/health Information: Did you notice that while implementing the new readiness check code in the application, that you did not have to restart the application or Liberty Server?

If the \u201cmemory\u201d used is less than 90%, the liveness probe sets the status to UP. If the \u201cmemory\u201d used is greater than 90%, the liveness probe sets the status to DOWN. From the Firefox Browser in the VM, rerun the /health endpoint to view the health status of the application. http://localhost:9080/health Note: in the case where there are multiple health checks being performed, as in our example, ALL the health checks must have the UP status for the service to be marked UP. So, what happens when we change the inMaintenance property to\u201ctrue\u201d? Let\u2019s modify the external configuration to set the service in maintenance mode and see the results of the health checks. Modify the inMaintenance property in the server.xml file a. Return to the VS Code console and navigate to START -> src -> main -> liberty / config b. Click on server.xml to open the file in the editor c. Modify the inMaintenance variable value to \u201c true \u201d as illustrated below d. Save the server.xml file. The server configuration is dynamically updated to reflect the update.

Save the server.xml file b. Close the server.xml editor view Rerun the /health endpoint to verify the service is now marked UP again. Running Tests using the Open Liberty Tools in VS Code In this section of the lab, you will make some simple changes to the sample application code and run test cases directly from the VS Code IDE using the built-in capabilities in the Open Liberty tools. To simulate a breaking change in the application code, you will modify the path to the service endpoint from /properties to /all-properties . Because the test case attempts to run the system service using the /properties path, the test case will fail and return an HTTP Code of 404, rather than the expected response code of 200. Since the developer is purposely introducing this change, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the new path to the service for the tests to pass. Use the Liberty Dev Dashboard to Run Tests against the System Properties Sample service. a. In VS Code, expand the LIBERTY DEV DASHBOARD section b. Right-mouse click on the guide-getting-started Liberty Server c. Select Run Test from the menu to run the tests d. In the Terminal view, you will see the results of the tests. One test was executed, and one test PASSED. Next, as a developer on the project, you have been asked to change the code to specify a different path to the \u201cproperties\u201d service. Doing so, has an impact on the tests. In the next few steps, you will make the code change, and update the tests to match the NEW expected results. Open the sytemResources.java in VS Code editor a. In VS Code Explorer view, expand START -> src -> main -> java / io / openliberty / sample / system b. Click on SystemResources.java to open it in the editor Update the @Path to the system properties service to specify a different service path a.

Since we changed the endpoint path, the test case assertion failed because it got a HTTP response code of 404 (Not Found) when attempting to run the service using the original path of /properties. d. Close the Failsafe Report in the Editor pane NOTE: In this case, we expected the test case to fail. And as the developer, you must update the test case to match the expected results based on to your code change. Modify the test case that is included in the application project> to invoke the updated path to the service. a. From the Explorer view in VS Code, navigate to START -> src -> test / java / it /io /openliberty / sample b. Click on PropertiesEndpointIT.java to open it in an editor pane c. From the editor, make the following change to the PropertiesEndpointIT.java file: Change the highlighted line: \u201csystem/properties\u201d Updated to read: \u201csystem/all-properties\u201d d. SAVE and CLOSE the file. The Liberty server and application are dynamically updated. Rerun the tests by Pressing the ENTER key in the Terminal view. The test PASS. At this point, you have explored using the Liberty Developer Tools to develop code, make server configuration changes, and run test cases to get immediate feedback on the updates. Using the Open Liberty Tools in VS Code provides an integrated development environment where your updates were automatically detected and dynamically applied to the running server. This provides a rapid inner-loop development cycle for development and testing. In the next section of the lab, you will explore how simple it is to integrate application debugging in the same development environment without having to restart the Liberty server. OPTIONAL: Integrated debugging using the Open Liberty Tools in VS Code Application debugging is an important part of application development. Developers expect to easily and quickly iterate through dev \u2013 test \u2013 debug without having to leave the development environment or having to restart servers and applications for debugging. In this section of the lab, you will explore how easy it is for developers to debug their Java application using the integrated development environment and Open Liberty. Here are the basics steps for debugging Set a breakpoint in the source code Add a \u201cJava Attach\u201d in the launch configuration and set the debug port Go to Debug view and select the \u201cAttach\u201d configuration Click the Start debugging icon Run the application in the Browser The application stops at the breakpoint Step through the app in debug mode to explore the variables and code to resolve issues One of the key features of Visual Studio Code is its great debugging support. In this section of the lab, you will use VS Code debigger to debug the Java application running on Liberty server. In this scenario, you will set a breakpoint and debug the SystemLivenessCheck.java code that is executed when running the /health endpoint in the application. Open the SystemLivenessCheck.java in VS Code editor a. In VS Code Explorer view, expand START -> src -> main -> java / io / openliberty / sample / system b.

Next, as a developer, you want to implement a health check for the application. The developer experience is frictionless, as all code and configuration change the developer introduces, are automatically detected and the server and application are dynamically updated in the running server to reflect the updated code and configuration. Let\u2019s explore a couple of examples of the very efficient developer experience by implementing some new capability into our service. In this example, you will leverage the mpHealth-2.2 feature in Open Liberty, which implements the MicroProfile mpHealth-2.2 API, to implement the new health checks for the application. The mpHealth-2.2 feature provides a /health endpoint that represents a binary status, either UP or DOWN, of the microservices that are installed. To learn more about the MicroProfile mpHealth feature, visit: https://www.openliberty.io/docs/21.0.0.4/health-check-microservices.html Update the Liberty server configuration file (server.xml) to include the mpHealth-2.2 feature to begin implementing the health checks for the application. a. In the VS Code Explorer view, navigate to START -> src -> main -> liberty / config b. Click on server.xml to open the file in the editor pane c. Add the mpHealth-2.2 feature to the server.xml file using the text below: <feature\\>mpHealth-2.2\\</feature\\> d. Save and Close the server.xml file When the server.xml file is saved, the configuration changes are detected, and the server is dynamically updated, installing the new feature and updating the application in the running server. View the messages in the Terminal view, showing the feature being installed and the application being updated. Once the changes are saved, and the server is automatically updated, the new / health endpoint is available. From the Firefox browser in the VM access the /health endpoint to view the health status of the application. **http://localhost:9080/health** Currently, the basic health check provides a simple status indicating if the service is running, but not if it is healthy. In the next steps, you will implement a liveness check that implements logic that gathers memory and cpu usage information and reports the service DOWN in the health check if the system resources exceed a certain threshold. You will also implement a readiness check that checks external property configuration in the server.xml file, that is used to place the service in maintenance mode. And if the service is in maintenance mode, the service is marked DOWN from the health check. Copy an implementation of the SystemReadinessCheck.java to the project a. Open a Terminal window on the VM b. Run the following command to copy the SystemReadinessCheck.java to the project cp /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/guide-getting-started/finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemReadinessCheck.java /home/ibmdemo/Student/labs/devmode/guide-getting-started/start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/sample/system/SystemReadinessCheck.java < Information: For the purposes of the lab, the copy command above copies a fully implemented Readiness check from the \u201cfinished\u201d project, into the current working project.

If the \u201cinMaintenance\u201d property is set to \u201c false \u201d the readiness check sets the Health Status to UP . If the inMaintenance property is set to \u201c true \u201d the status is set to DOWN . From the Firefox Browser in the VM, rerun the /health endpoint to view the health status of the application. http://localhost:9080/health Information: Did you notice that while implementing the new readiness check code in the application, that you did not have to restart the application or Liberty Server?

It accelerates application migrating to cloud process, minimize errors and risks and reduce time to market. 1. Introduction As shown in the image below, your company has several web applications deployed to WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment. Your company wants to move these applications to the modern WebSphere Liberty server on a container-based cloud. However, you are not sure how much effort the migration process might take. You decide to use the IBM Transformation Advisor to do a quick evaluation of these applications without their source code to identify a good candidate application to move to Liberty and container-based cloud. After determining a candidate application for modernization to WebSphere Liberty, you use the accelerators generated by TA to deploy and run the application to WebSphere Liberty on your local developer machine and in containers to validate the solution. 2. Objective The objectives of this lab are to: Learn how to collect Java application and configuration data using the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool. Learn how to use the Transformation Advisor to evaluate the effort involved to modernize to Liberty and container-based clouds and identify good application candidates for modernization. Learn how to use the accelerators generated by Transformation Advisor to deploy a candidate application to WebSphere Liberty and containers. 3. Prerequisites The following prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning this lab: Familiarity with basic Linux commands Have internet access Have a SkyTap lab environment ready 4. The lab environment One Linux VM is included in the environment and has been provided for this lab. The Workstation-Liberty-TA-M2m VM will be referred as the \u201c workstation \u201d VM throughout the lab. The login credentials for the workstation VM are: User ID: ibmdemo Password: passw0rd Transformation Advisor (TA) has already been installed on the Workstation VM. TA local runs in Docker containers. Get started using Transformation Adviser for yourself: http://ibm.biz/cloudta 5. Lab Tasks In this lab, you will use the Transformation Advisor to identify a good candidate application for moving to WebSphere Liberty and containers. To identify which Java EE programming models are on the server, you would typically run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against a WebSphere server or cell. For this lab, you will simulate the process of running the data collector which generates a \u201cdata collection\u201d which is a zip file containing the inventory of the application, structure of each application, the WebSphere server configuration required for the application, and various analysis reports. For this lab environment, the data collection zip archive file has already been generated. You will import that zip file into the Transformation Advisor UI for application analysis. Using Transformation Advisor, you will gain insights into potential migration issues that may need to be remediated if you move the application to Liberty and containers. Reviewing the analysis reports, you will determine the complexity of the development effort required and select a candidate application to migrate to Liberty in a container-based cloud. Here are the activities involved in this process: Simulate running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the WebSphere Application Server to get application data Upload the data collection zip archive file that was generated by the data collector, into Transformation Advisor UI for analysis. Review the analysis and reports that Transformation Advisor generates to identify the right candidate application for a rapid and cost-effective migration to Liberty and container-based cloud. 6.

Login with ibmdemo ID. Click on the ibmdemo icon on the screen. When prompted for the password for ibmdemo , enter \" password \" as the password: Resize the Skytap environment window for a larger viewing area while doing the lab. From the Skytap menu bar, click on the \" Fit to Size \" icon. This will enlarge the viewing area to fit the size of your browser window. 6.2 The WebSphere applications to be assessed The illustration below shows the WebSphere applications that are deployed to the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment. We already ran the Transformation Advisor Data Collection tool against the WebSphere server and provided the resulting data collection zip archive file on the Workstation VM to be used in the lab. You will simulate the data collection process. However, not actually run the data collector since this lab environment does not have access to the WebSphere environment. As illustrated below, Transformation Advisor will collect the application data for the following five applications. During the analysis of these applications, you will gain important insights regarding these applications, their JEE technologies used, relative complexity of each application, and detailed analysis of the overall effort and complexity of moving each application to Liberty and container-based cloud environments. In the Enterprise Applications list above, you can see the applications that deployed to the WebSphere Application Server environment. Next, you use Transformation Advisor to analyze these applications to identify a good candidate to be moved to Liberty. 6.3 Launch Transformation Advisor (local) The Transformation Advisor can evaluate any Java based applications. In this lab, you are going to use it to evaluate whether the on-premises WebSphere application, Mod Resorts , is suitable to move to Liberty and what the effort might be to get it there. The Transformation Advisor is installed locally on the Workstation VM. Launch the Transformation Advisor tool using the steps below. From Workstation VM Desktop Tool Bar, click the Terminal icon to open a Terminal window. Clone the GitHub repo that includes artifacts required for this lab cd /home/ibmdemo git clone https://github.com/IBMTechSales/student-tech-academy-platform.git Once completed, the local lab artifacts repo is cloned at /home/ibmdemo/student-tech-academy-platform directory on the Workstation desktop. Launch the Transformation Advisor with commands: cd /home/ibmdemo/TA_LOCAL/transformationAdvisor/transformation-advisor-local-3.2.1 ./launchTransformationAdvisor.sh Wait for Transformation Advisor to initialize and display the action menu list. Type 5 and press Enter to start the Transformation Advisor . The Transformation Advisor application is started, right-click the application URL link and select Open Link to launch it in a web browser window This Transformation Advisor Home page is displayed in the Web Browser. In the next section, you will use the Transformation Advisor UI to download the data collector utility for the environment that the WebSphere Application Server would be running, such as Windows or Linux. 6.4 Download Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility Now the Transformation Advisor is running, you will download its Data Collector utility that would run on a WebSphere Application Server. To evaluate on-premises Java applications, you need to run Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility against the Application server environment. It will extract application information from the environment. The utility can be downloaded from the Transformation Advisor UI. From the Transformation Advisor Home page, create a new workspace a. Click the Create New button b. Enter the workspace name as Evaluation, then click the Create button A workspace is a designated area that will house the migration recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor from your application server environment. You can name and organize these however you want, whether it\u2019s by business application, location, or teams Once the Workspace is created, you will have options to either download the Data Collector utility or upload existing data file. In this lab, we are going to perform the following steps: Download the Data Collector utility for the Linux environment Simulate running the data collector Upload an existing data collection zip file into Transformation Advisor for analysis Use the accelerators generated by Transformation Advisor to deploy the Mod Resorts application to Liberty, and to containers. Click the Download button to download the data collector for Linux In the Download page, you can download data collector utility based on your source operating system for your WebSphere environment. It also shows how to use the command line utility to collect application and configuration data from WebSphere, WebLogic, and Tomcat servers. a. Since the lab VM is a Linux OS, click Download Linux to get the utility. b. In the Chrome browser window, when the download is complete, you will see the file shown in the bottom banner of the browser window. The zipped Data Collector utility file will be saved in / home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory of the Workstation VM. Continue to the next section of the lab to simulate running the data collector utility. 6.5 Simulate running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility After downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, it needs to be unpacked and run against a WebSphere Application server (WAS) to collect all the data of deployed applications and their configuration from the WAS server. Now, let\u2019s simulate the steps to run the data collector. Go back to the terminal window and navigate the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory and view its contents with commands: cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/ ls -l | grep transformationadvisor You can see the downloaded data collector utility file named \u201c transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation.tgz \u201d Extract the data collector utility using the following command: tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation.tgz The data collector utility will be extracted to /home/ibmdemo/Downloads /transformationadvisor-3.2.1 directory. Note: At this point, the data collector is ready to execute against a WebSphere environment. Return to the Transformation Advisor UI in the Web browser to view the section on \u201c Run the Tool \u201d, which shows the command to run on the WebSphere environment. a. From the Data Collector page, scroll down to the \u201c Run Tool \u201d section. The data collector command that would be executed is based on the domain and analysis type selections you make in this section. Choose the IBM WebSphere Domain. Other domains include other JAVA EE runtimes. Note: The data collector tool command changes based on this selection. Select the Analysis type of \u201c Apps and Configuration \u201d Selecting Apps & Configuration ensures that the application data and server configuration data is collected. The server configuration data is extremely helpful in Transformation Advisor to generate deployment artifacts in the migration bundle, which we will explore later in the lab. Review the data collector command that is shown based on your selections. If you were going to run the command, there are a few additional things that need to happen. Replace the \\<WEBSPHERE_HOME_DIR> and \\<PROFILE_NAME> variables with the values from the WebSphere environment If the WebSphere environment is not connected to the VM where Transformation Advisor is running, then the data collector utility that was downloaded must be copied and unpacked to the WebSphere environment. 6.5.1 FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY: Simulation of running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility Important: This section is for illustrative purposes only. DO NOT RUN THE COMMANDS shown! If the WebSphere Application Server and Transformation Advisor has connectivity, the data collector could be run as follows. Example of the Data Collector utility command to start collect the deployed applications information on the WebSphere Application server. ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /opt/ibm/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 Type 1 to accept the license agreement and press Enter , as illustrated below The utility will start to collect application data. This process takes time to complete, depending on how many applications are deployed on the WebSphere Application server. When the collection utility completes, you will see the following message; \u201c Thank you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis.\u201d Your application data is collected, it is saved as a zip file \u201c AppSrv01.zip\u201d , named based on the WebSphere profile that was analyzed. In general, if your application server and the Transformation Advisor are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data will be automatically uploaded to Transformation Advisor for you to view the analysis results. Otherwise, you must manually upload the data to Transformation Advisor before you can view the results. 6.6 Upload the data collection into Transformation Advisor In this section, you will upload the data collection zip file \u201c AppSrv01.zip \u201d from the WebSphere environment for analysis. Typically, before you can upload the data collector zip files, you will need to download the appropriate data collector for your target environments operation environment, such as Linux, Windows, etc. Additionally, you would run the data collector in the target environment to collect the data for your applications. Then, you can import the collection data into Transformation Advisor for analysis. Tip: As noted in the previous section, the data collection steps have already been done, and the resulting AppSrv01.zip file is provided for you in the lab environment. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page in the web browser, click the \u201c Workload type \u201d link to go to the Recommendations page. From the Evaluation workspace, upload the \u201c AppSrv01.zip \u201d data collection file a. Click the Upload button to upload a data collection file b. From the Upload Data page, click the Drop or add file link c. Navigate to the location of the data collection file and add the AppSrv01.zip file. Then click the Open button on the Download page. Home > ibmdemo > openshift-workshop-was > labs > Liberty > TA-labs > AppSrv01.zip d. The AppSrv01.zip data collection file is now ready to be uploaded. Click the Upload button to continue. Once the data collection has been uploaded to Transformation Advisor, you are redirected back to the TA Recommendations screen. Notice that the page shows \u201c All Java applications \u201d from the WebSphere Application Server profile named AppSrv01 . The following details are included in the workspace summary: Total Applications : The total number of applications in the workspace. Avg. cost per application : The average number of days of development effort required to migrate an application. Common Code : The total cost to migrate all the common code in the workspace to the target platform. Unique app code : The total cost to migrate all the unique app code (code that is not shared between applications) in the workspace to the target platform. Total cost : The total cost to migrate all the applications and common code in the workspace to the target platform. In the next section, you will use Transformation Advisor to view the application data analysis that was collected. 6.7 Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications In this section, you are going to use the Transformation Advisor UI to view the application data analysis results that was collected in the previous section. From the \u201c All Java applications\u201d page, you can see there was a total of 5 applications analyzed from the WAS server. When data is uploaded, Transformation Advisor automatically detects the host machine the data came from, meaning, where the WebSphere application server apps were running. TA creates a corresponding collection and adds the applications there. The collection name can be overridden when running the data collector or edited in the transformation Advisor UI after the data is uploaded. In this example, the default collection name is used: admin.ibm.demo , which is the host machine where the data came from. Click on the \u201c Collections \u201d drop-down icon and view the collection name: \u201c admin.ibm.demo \u201d Transformation advisor analyzes all the application code and common code that is shared across applications and provides an estimated total cost for migrating the apps and common code in the workspace. Total cost is the number of days of development cost to migrate that code to run on the selected migration target . In this example, WebSphere Liberty is the selected migration target. The Migration targets include: Open Liberty WebSphere Liberty WebSphere Traditional You can choose multiple migration targets and Transformation Advisor will provide the workspace total cost effort for each of the selected targets. This provides a high-level view of the scope of work to migrate all the applications in the collection to specific migration targets. Depending on the applications, you may find that the effort to migrate to Open Liberty requires more effort that migrating to WebSphere Liberty. This is because Open Liberty does not include all the Java EE API specifications that are included in WebSphere Liberty. Click on the Migration targets drop-down and select all three migration targets and notice the different development costs associated with migration all 5 applications in the workspace to the various migration target environments. Here you can see that moving the applications in the collection to WebSphere traditional requires zero development costs, meaning there is no code changes necessary. However, moving to WebSphere Liberty may require 2.5 days and Open Liberty may take 6 days of development time to update the application code to run on those target runtimes. The \u201c All Java applications\u201d page also shows the application summary analysis results for all the apps from the AppSrv01 profile for each of the selected migration targets. For each app / migration target combination, you can see these results: Java application Collection / Profile name Complexity Issues Common code files Application cost (in days) Migration plan The following details are included in the summary table (this is the per-application view): Application Name : The name of the EAR/WAR file found on the application server. Collection/Profile : Collection represents the hostname of the machine where the application resides. The profile represents the profile name in the application server where the application is installed. Complexity : Indicates how complex Transformation Advisor considers this application to be if you were to migrate it to the cloud. Issues : The number and severity of potential issues with the migration of the application. Common code files : The number of common code files this aplication uses. A file is considered common if it is from a Shared Library or is used by at least one other application. Application cost in days : Provides an estimate in days for the development effort to perform the migration for just this application. Cost estimates calculated by Transformation Advisor are high-level estimates only and may vary widely based on skills and other factors not considered by the tool. Migration plan : accelerator files generated by Transformation advisor to aide in building and deploying the selected application to the target runtime. Mod Resorts is one of the applications that we want to consider migration to Liberty. In this section you will review the analysis results for the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application and determine if it is a good candidate for migration to Open Liberty or WebSphere liberty. First, let\u2019s narrow the focus in Transformation Advisor to view only the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application. a. In the search bar, type modresorts which will narrow the application list to only the Mod Resorts application for all three migration targets In this example, if you want to move the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application to Open Liberty, the complexity level is Simple , which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to Open Liberty. The application has no dependency, does not have any common code or shared library files. It has two minor (informational level) issues. The estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required. Notice that the modresorts application is also simple to migrate to the WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere traditional migration targets. For this lab, you will focus on the modernization of moderesorts-1.0_war.ear to Open Liberty. Next, you will look at the analysis results for moderesorts-1_0_war.ear application in detail. Click the modresorts-1_0_war.ear link targeting Open Liberty to expand its analysis results. The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity rules section . The overall complexity for the application is simple , indicating that the application can be directly moved to Open Liberty without any code change. Scroll down to Complexity Rules section. You can see there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 0 days . This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating the application code, but does not encompass the full scope of a migration project that would include server configuration, testing, etc. Expand the Issues and details section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Technology Report link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. The Technology report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS. It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application. TIP: If the complexity of migrating to the target environment is \u201c Complex \u201d , it means that some APIs are not available in the target runtime and application will have to be rewritten to use different APIs. As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere editions. Go back to the Transformation Advisor browser tab and click the Analysis Report link. The Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window. This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level. a. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules. For the Mod Resorts application, there are two warning rules regarding the application configuration in Docker containers. b. Click the Show results link next to the warning rules. You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is, or potential issue may be. c. Click the Show rule help link. This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue. For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the Inventory Report link. The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships, and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application, and the Java package names in the jar files, which will help identify if the classes are the customers application code or 3 rd party code. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them. In the Inventory report, view the package names of the classes in the utility Jars a. Scroll down to view the Contained Archives section and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to modresorts-1.0.war b. Then scroll down to the Utility JAR files and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to Utility JAR files c. View the Archive names of the jar files and the packages used in the JAR files. This is a good way to determine if the code in the utility JARS include customer code or if they are 3 rd party jars like (org.pache*). Additionally, if the application migration complexity is SIMPLE, you may want to verify if the utility jars include any company packages that begin with org or other package names that are IGNORED by default in the Transformation Advisor data collector. It could be possible that application code was not analyzed due to package names that are ignored by the data collector From the analysis reports you reviewed above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Open Liberty, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for migrating to Open Liberty with minimal effort. 6.8 Overview of the Mod Resorts application From the insights gained from Transformation Advisor, you learned that the Mod Resorts is a simple EE application and is a good candidate for moving to Open Liberty and container-based clouds. For illustration purposes, in this short section, a few screen shots are captured to illustrate the Mod Resorts application. The Mod Resorts application home page is illustrated here: The user would select the destination of their travel Perhaps the user wants to go to PARIS, FRANCE. Mod Resorts shows the weather of the city. Continue to the next section of the lab where you are briefly introduced to Transformation Advisor\u2019s migration plan. The migration plan includes a migration bundle of generated deployment artifact that accelerate the deployment of the application to Liberty and container-based cloud deployment. 7. Explore the migration bundle for the Mod Resorts application Transformation Advisor display details about the migration bundle that it generated to accelerate the modernization of applications to Liberty or traditional WebSphere in containers and to OpenShift. The migration bundle includes diverse artifacts, depending on the needs of the application to accelerate the build and deployment of an application Docker image into OpenShift platform. The user can choose to create a migration bundle for either: binary project of an application (uploading a WAR/EAR file and its dependent libraries) source code project of an application, so that the application source files can be modernized and maintained Now, let\u2019s quickly explore the Migration Plan for the Mod Resorts application to see the artifacts that Transformation Advisor creates to expedite the app deployment to OpenShift Platform. Return to the \u201c All Java applications \u201d page in Transformation Advisor which displays the Java application summary list Ensure only the Open Liberty migration target is selected Click on the Migration plan link located next to the Mod Resorts application analysis for Open Liberty, which will display migration plan for modresorts for the Open Liberty target Select the Binary option in the migration plan. Using the Binary option requires that you upload the Mod Resorts application binary (WAR or EAR), which will be included in the migration bundle along with the deployment artifacts that Transformation Advisor generated. a. Select Manual upload option under the Application dependencies section. Here you will manually upload the Mod Resorts WAR file to the migration bundle. b. Click the \u201c Drag or add file\u201d link to add the md resorts WAR file to the migration bundle c. Navigate to: Home > ibmdemo > openshift-workshop-was > labs > Liberty > TA-labs > modresorts-1.0.war Scroll down to the Migration Files section of the migration plan. Notice the files that were generated by Transformation Advisor to accelerate build and deployment of the application to Liberty, containers, and OpenShift. To accelerate the application modernization, the artifacts produced by Transformation Advisor include: server.xml : the configuration for the Liberty server pom.xml : Build the application using Maven Application CR : Custom Resource for the application to be deployed to OpenShift via the Open Liberty Operator Dockerfile : Create the Docker image for the application The user will be able to choose to download the artifacts as a migration bundle or send the bundle contents into a Git repository . Click the Download bundle link to download the bundle of artifacts to the local filesystem on the Workstation VM. The modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip file will be downloaded to the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory Unzip the migration bundle artifacts to a new folder on the Workstation VM a. From a terminal window, run the following commands to unzip the migration bundle to a new directory named \" modresorts-bundle \": mkdir /home/ibmdemo/modresorts-bundle cd /home/ibmdemo/modresorts-bundle cp ~/Downloads/modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip ~/modresorts-bundle unzip ~/modresorts-bundle/modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip ls View the server.xml file. DO NOT CHANGE THE FILE CONTENTS. The server.xml file in the migration bundle is the Liberty server configuration file generated by Transformation Advisor, configured for the modresorts application. gedit ~/modresorts-bundle/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml The Liberty features list include features that the application requires. mpMetrics feature is included, which provides a /metrics endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications. Variables are used so that the values that are likely to be different between environments can easily be overridden by external configurations like environment variables or configMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes. Close the editor when you finish reviewing the file. DO NOT SAVE any changes to the contents. View the Dockerfile file. Do not change the file contents. The Dockerfile file in the migration bundle is used to build the container image for running the modresorts application on a Liberty runtime in a containerized environment such ads Docker, Kubernetes, or Red Hat OpenShift. The Dockerfile was generated by Transformation Advisor, configured for the building the modresorts application. gedit ~/modresorts-bundle/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is a two-stage Dockerfile. The first phase is the \u201c build-stage \u201d that creates a docker image for the modresorts application. The second stage uses the Open Liberty kernel container image and the build artifacts produced from the \u201cbuild-stage\u201d to build the modresorts container image with the modresorts application and configuration files for deploying to a container environment. Close the editor when you finish reviewing the file. DO NOT SAVE any changes to the contents. 8. Use Transformation Advisor deployment accelerators to deploy and run the Mod Resorts application on Open Liberty In this section, you will install Open Liberty, create a new Liberty server, and leverage the artifacts generated by Transformation Advisor to configure and run the Mod Resorts application on your new Open Liberty server. Tip: Open Liberty is installed from a zip archive file. For the lab, the Open Liberty zip archive has already been downloaded to the lab environment. To get started, you will create a new directory where you would like to install Open Liberty. Then unzip the archive. That\u2019s it, Open Liberty is installed. Install Open Liberty on the VM a. From a Terminal window, run the following commands to perform an archive installation of Open Liberty mkdir ~/Liberty cd ~/Liberty unzip ~/Student/labs/TA-labs/openliberty-javaee8-21.0.0.12.zip -d ~/Liberty b. Open Liberty is installed to the \\~/Liberty/wlp directory. Change to Open Liberty \u201c bin \u201d directory, which is where the Open Liberty binaries are located. cd wlp/bin Use the server command to create a new Open Liberty server named modresorts_server ./server create modresorts_server Use the server command to start the Open Liberty server named modresorts_server ./server start modresorts_server Open a new Terminal window and view the Open Liberty server log file named \u201cmessages.log\u201d tail -f ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server/logs/messages.log a. Look for the message that the modresorts server started successfully At this point you have an Open Liberty Server running with a defaultserver configuration. However, there are no applications installed(deployed). Next, you will copy the Open Liberty server configuration file that TA generated for the Mod Resorts application. Then you will copy the Mod Resorts binary (WAR) to the Open Liberty server, in which case the application will be deployed and started. Copy the server.xml file that Transformation Advisor, which includes the Open Liberty server configuration for the modresorts application a. Return to the Terminal window where you started the Open Liberty Server. b. Run the following command to copy the server.xml file to the modresorts_server configuration directory. cp ~/modresorts-bundle/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server c. In the Terminal window running the \u201c tail \u201d command on the Open Liberty log file, notice that the server is being updated to reflect the updates in the new server.xml file that we copied into the Liberty runtime configuration. Note: You will see messages that specific Liberty features being removed, and others being added, based on the new server.xml file that is loaded. Install the modresorts application to the Open Liberty server, using the WAR file that is included in the Transformation Advisor migration bundle. cp ~/modresorts-bundle/target/modresorts-1.0.war ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server/apps The command above copied the modresorts application WAR file to the Open Liberty \u201c apps \u201d folder, which where the server.xml file is configured to run the application. In the Terminal window running the \u201c tail \u201d command on the Open Liberty log file, notice that the server is being updated to reflect the modresorts application being started. Run the modresorts application from the Chrome browser on the VM. The context root for the application is \u201c/resorts\u201d and is defined in the Open Liberty server.xml file. http://localhost:9080/resorts a. You may click the drop-down menu for \u201c WHERE TO ?\u201d and select a destination Tip! If the application does not respond when clicking on the \u201cWHERE TO?\u201d menu, increase the window size of the Chrome browser. This appears to be a glitch with the application or Chrome browser Stop the Open Liberty server a. Return to the Terminal window where you started the Open Liberty Server b. Run the following command to stop the server named modresorts_server ./server stop modresorts_server Use CTL-C to Stop the \u201c tail \u201d command in the 2 nd Terminal window 9. Use Transformation Advisor accelerators to run the Mod Resorts application on Open Liberty in containers In this section, you will use the Dockerfile to build a docker image and run the modresorts application in a local Docker container. The Dockerfile is a two-stage Dockerfile: - The first phase is the \u201c build-stage \u201d that creates a docker image for the modresorts application. - The second stage uses the Open Liberty kernel container image and the build artifacts produced from the \u201cbuild-stage\u201d to build the modresorts container image with the modresorts application and configuration files for deploying to a container environment. - **RUN features.sh** downloads the Open Liberty features that are defined in the server.xml file - **RUN configure.sh** installs the Open Liberty features into the Docker image. Build the Docker image that includes the modresorts application on Open Liberty a. From a Terminal window, change to the directory where the Transformation Advisor migration bundle is located. b. Run the Docker build command to build the image The name of the docker image will be modresorts:1.0, as specified by the -t (tag) parameter. The Dockerfile used is in the current directory, as specified by the training dot on the command cd ~/modresorts-bundle docker build --no-cache -t modresorts:1.0 . When complete, you will see that the Docker image was created and tagged as \u201c modresorts:1.0 \u201d c. List the Docker image and its tag. The name of the image is \u201c modresorts \u201d and is tagged as \u201c 1.0 \u201d docker images | grep modresorts Run the Docker image -d runs the docker command in detached mode -p maps the internal pot 9080 to an external port 9081 --name specifies the name for the docker container that gets spun up Modresorts:1.0 is the name of the docker image to use to spin up the new container docker run -d -p 9081:9080 --name modresorts modresorts:1.0 Verify the docker container is running docker ps | grep modresorts The \u201c docker ps \u201d command lists docker containers that are \u201crunning\u201d.

From the \u201c All Java applications\u201d page, you can see there was a total of 5 applications analyzed from the WAS server. When data is uploaded, Transformation Advisor automatically detects the host machine the data came from, meaning, where the WebSphere application server apps were running. TA creates a corresponding collection and adds the applications there. The collection name can be overridden when running the data collector or edited in the transformation Advisor UI after the data is uploaded. In this example, the default collection name is used: admin.ibm.demo , which is the host machine where the data came from. Click on the \u201c Collections \u201d drop-down icon and view the collection name: \u201c admin.ibm.demo \u201d Transformation advisor analyzes all the application code and common code that is shared across applications and provides an estimated total cost for migrating the apps and common code in the workspace. Total cost is the number of days of development cost to migrate that code to run on the selected migration target . In this example, WebSphere Liberty is the selected migration target. The Migration targets include: Open Liberty WebSphere Liberty WebSphere Traditional You can choose multiple migration targets and Transformation Advisor will provide the workspace total cost effort for each of the selected targets. This provides a high-level view of the scope of work to migrate all the applications in the collection to specific migration targets. Depending on the applications, you may find that the effort to migrate to Open Liberty requires more effort that migrating to WebSphere Liberty. This is because Open Liberty does not include all the Java EE API specifications that are included in WebSphere Liberty. Click on the Migration targets drop-down and select all three migration targets and notice the different development costs associated with migration all 5 applications in the workspace to the various migration target environments. Here you can see that moving the applications in the collection to WebSphere traditional requires zero development costs, meaning there is no code changes necessary. However, moving to WebSphere Liberty may require 2.5 days and Open Liberty may take 6 days of development time to update the application code to run on those target runtimes. The \u201c All Java applications\u201d page also shows the application summary analysis results for all the apps from the AppSrv01 profile for each of the selected migration targets. For each app / migration target combination, you can see these results: Java application Collection / Profile name Complexity Issues Common code files Application cost (in days) Migration plan The following details are included in the summary table (this is the per-application view): Application Name : The name of the EAR/WAR file found on the application server. Collection/Profile : Collection represents the hostname of the machine where the application resides. The profile represents the profile name in the application server where the application is installed. Complexity : Indicates how complex Transformation Advisor considers this application to be if you were to migrate it to the cloud. Issues : The number and severity of potential issues with the migration of the application. Common code files : The number of common code files this aplication uses. A file is considered common if it is from a Shared Library or is used by at least one other application. Application cost in days : Provides an estimate in days for the development effort to perform the migration for just this application. Cost estimates calculated by Transformation Advisor are high-level estimates only and may vary widely based on skills and other factors not considered by the tool. Migration plan : accelerator files generated by Transformation advisor to aide in building and deploying the selected application to the target runtime. Mod Resorts is one of the applications that we want to consider migration to Liberty. In this section you will review the analysis results for the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application and determine if it is a good candidate for migration to Open Liberty or WebSphere liberty. First, let\u2019s narrow the focus in Transformation Advisor to view only the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application. a. In the search bar, type modresorts which will narrow the application list to only the Mod Resorts application for all three migration targets In this example, if you want to move the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application to Open Liberty, the complexity level is Simple , which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to Open Liberty. The application has no dependency, does not have any common code or shared library files. It has two minor (informational level) issues. The estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required. Notice that the modresorts application is also simple to migrate to the WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere traditional migration targets. For this lab, you will focus on the modernization of moderesorts-1.0_war.ear to Open Liberty. Next, you will look at the analysis results for moderesorts-1_0_war.ear application in detail. Click the modresorts-1_0_war.ear link targeting Open Liberty to expand its analysis results. The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity rules section . The overall complexity for the application is simple , indicating that the application can be directly moved to Open Liberty without any code change. Scroll down to Complexity Rules section. You can see there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 0 days . This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating the application code, but does not encompass the full scope of a migration project that would include server configuration, testing, etc. Expand the Issues and details section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Technology Report link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. The Technology report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS. It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application. TIP: If the complexity of migrating to the target environment is \u201c Complex \u201d , it means that some APIs are not available in the target runtime and application will have to be rewritten to use different APIs. As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere editions. Go back to the Transformation Advisor browser tab and click the Analysis Report link. The Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window. This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level. a. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules. For the Mod Resorts application, there are two warning rules regarding the application configuration in Docker containers. b. Click the Show results link next to the warning rules. You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is, or potential issue may be. c. Click the Show rule help link. This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue. For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the Inventory Report link. The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships, and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application, and the Java package names in the jar files, which will help identify if the classes are the customers application code or 3 rd party code. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them. In the Inventory report, view the package names of the classes in the utility Jars a. Scroll down to view the Contained Archives section and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to modresorts-1.0.war b. Then scroll down to the Utility JAR files and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to Utility JAR files c. View the Archive names of the jar files and the packages used in the JAR files. This is a good way to determine if the code in the utility JARS include customer code or if they are 3 rd party jars like (org.pache*). Additionally, if the application migration complexity is SIMPLE, you may want to verify if the utility jars include any company packages that begin with org or other package names that are IGNORED by default in the Transformation Advisor data collector. It could be possible that application code was not analyzed due to package names that are ignored by the data collector From the analysis reports you reviewed above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Open Liberty, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for migrating to Open Liberty with minimal effort.","title":"6.7 Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications"},{"location":"lab-guides/md/lab5/#68-overview-of-the-mod-resorts-application","text":"From the insights gained from Transformation Advisor, you learned that the Mod Resorts is a simple EE application and is a good candidate for moving to Open Liberty and container-based clouds.

Introduction As shown in the image below, your company has several web applications deployed to WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment. Your company wants to move these applications to the modern WebSphere Liberty server on a container-based cloud. However, you are not sure how much effort the migration process might take. You decide to use the IBM Transformation Advisor to do a quick evaluation of these applications without their source code to identify a good candidate application to move to Liberty and container-based cloud. After determining a candidate application for modernization to WebSphere Liberty, you use the accelerators generated by TA to deploy and run the application to WebSphere Liberty on your local developer machine and in containers to validate the solution. 2. Objective The objectives of this lab are to: Learn how to collect Java application and configuration data using the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool. Learn how to use the Transformation Advisor to evaluate the effort involved to modernize to Liberty and container-based clouds and identify good application candidates for modernization. Learn how to use the accelerators generated by Transformation Advisor to deploy a candidate application to WebSphere Liberty and containers. 3. Prerequisites The following prerequisites must be completed prior to beginning this lab: Familiarity with basic Linux commands Have internet access Have a SkyTap lab environment ready 4. The lab environment One Linux VM is included in the environment and has been provided for this lab. The Workstation-Liberty-TA-M2m VM will be referred as the \u201c workstation \u201d VM throughout the lab. The login credentials for the workstation VM are: User ID: ibmdemo Password: passw0rd Transformation Advisor (TA) has already been installed on the Workstation VM. TA local runs in Docker containers. Get started using Transformation Adviser for yourself: http://ibm.biz/cloudta 5. Lab Tasks In this lab, you will use the Transformation Advisor to identify a good candidate application for moving to WebSphere Liberty and containers. To identify which Java EE programming models are on the server, you would typically run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against a WebSphere server or cell. For this lab, you will simulate the process of running the data collector which generates a \u201cdata collection\u201d which is a zip file containing the inventory of the application, structure of each application, the WebSphere server configuration required for the application, and various analysis reports. For this lab environment, the data collection zip archive file has already been generated. You will import that zip file into the Transformation Advisor UI for application analysis. Using Transformation Advisor, you will gain insights into potential migration issues that may need to be remediated if you move the application to Liberty and containers. Reviewing the analysis reports, you will determine the complexity of the development effort required and select a candidate application to migrate to Liberty in a container-based cloud. Here are the activities involved in this process: Simulate running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the WebSphere Application Server to get application data Upload the data collection zip archive file that was generated by the data collector, into Transformation Advisor UI for analysis. Review the analysis and reports that Transformation Advisor generates to identify the right candidate application for a rapid and cost-effective migration to Liberty and container-based cloud. 6. Execute Lab Tasks 6.1 Log in to the workstation VM and Get Started If the VM is not already started, start it by clicking the play button for the whole group.

This will enlarge the viewing area to fit the size of your browser window. 6.2 The WebSphere applications to be assessed The illustration below shows the WebSphere applications that are deployed to the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment. We already ran the Transformation Advisor Data Collection tool against the WebSphere server and provided the resulting data collection zip archive file on the Workstation VM to be used in the lab. You will simulate the data collection process. However, not actually run the data collector since this lab environment does not have access to the WebSphere environment. As illustrated below, Transformation Advisor will collect the application data for the following five applications. During the analysis of these applications, you will gain important insights regarding these applications, their JEE technologies used, relative complexity of each application, and detailed analysis of the overall effort and complexity of moving each application to Liberty and container-based cloud environments. In the Enterprise Applications list above, you can see the applications that deployed to the WebSphere Application Server environment. Next, you use Transformation Advisor to analyze these applications to identify a good candidate to be moved to Liberty. 6.3 Launch Transformation Advisor (local) The Transformation Advisor can evaluate any Java based applications. In this lab, you are going to use it to evaluate whether the on-premises WebSphere application, Mod Resorts , is suitable to move to Liberty and what the effort might be to get it there. The Transformation Advisor is installed locally on the Workstation VM. Launch the Transformation Advisor tool using the steps below. From Workstation VM Desktop Tool Bar, click the Terminal icon to open a Terminal window. Clone the GitHub repo that includes artifacts required for this lab cd /home/ibmdemo git clone https://github.com/IBMTechSales/student-tech-academy-platform.git Once completed, the local lab artifacts repo is cloned at /home/ibmdemo/student-tech-academy-platform directory on the Workstation desktop. Launch the Transformation Advisor with commands: cd /home/ibmdemo/TA_LOCAL/transformationAdvisor/transformation-advisor-local-3.2.1 ./launchTransformationAdvisor.sh Wait for Transformation Advisor to initialize and display the action menu list. Type 5 and press Enter to start the Transformation Advisor . The Transformation Advisor application is started, right-click the application URL link and select Open Link to launch it in a web browser window This Transformation Advisor Home page is displayed in the Web Browser. In the next section, you will use the Transformation Advisor UI to download the data collector utility for the environment that the WebSphere Application Server would be running, such as Windows or Linux. 6.4 Download Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility Now the Transformation Advisor is running, you will download its Data Collector utility that would run on a WebSphere Application Server. To evaluate on-premises Java applications, you need to run Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility against the Application server environment. It will extract application information from the environment. The utility can be downloaded from the Transformation Advisor UI. From the Transformation Advisor Home page, create a new workspace a. Click the Create New button b. Enter the workspace name as Evaluation, then click the Create button A workspace is a designated area that will house the migration recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor from your application server environment. You can name and organize these however you want, whether it\u2019s by business application, location, or teams Once the Workspace is created, you will have options to either download the Data Collector utility or upload existing data file. In this lab, we are going to perform the following steps: Download the Data Collector utility for the Linux environment Simulate running the data collector Upload an existing data collection zip file into Transformation Advisor for analysis Use the accelerators generated by Transformation Advisor to deploy the Mod Resorts application to Liberty, and to containers. Click the Download button to download the data collector for Linux In the Download page, you can download data collector utility based on your source operating system for your WebSphere environment. It also shows how to use the command line utility to collect application and configuration data from WebSphere, WebLogic, and Tomcat servers. a. Since the lab VM is a Linux OS, click Download Linux to get the utility. b. In the Chrome browser window, when the download is complete, you will see the file shown in the bottom banner of the browser window. The zipped Data Collector utility file will be saved in / home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory of the Workstation VM. Continue to the next section of the lab to simulate running the data collector utility. 6.5 Simulate running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility After downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, it needs to be unpacked and run against a WebSphere Application server (WAS) to collect all the data of deployed applications and their configuration from the WAS server. Now, let\u2019s simulate the steps to run the data collector. Go back to the terminal window and navigate the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory and view its contents with commands: cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/ ls -l | grep transformationadvisor You can see the downloaded data collector utility file named \u201c transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation.tgz \u201d Extract the data collector utility using the following command: tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux_Evaluation.tgz The data collector utility will be extracted to /home/ibmdemo/Downloads /transformationadvisor-3.2.1 directory. Note: At this point, the data collector is ready to execute against a WebSphere environment. Return to the Transformation Advisor UI in the Web browser to view the section on \u201c Run the Tool \u201d, which shows the command to run on the WebSphere environment. a. From the Data Collector page, scroll down to the \u201c Run Tool \u201d section. The data collector command that would be executed is based on the domain and analysis type selections you make in this section. Choose the IBM WebSphere Domain. Other domains include other JAVA EE runtimes. Note: The data collector tool command changes based on this selection. Select the Analysis type of \u201c Apps and Configuration \u201d Selecting Apps & Configuration ensures that the application data and server configuration data is collected. The server configuration data is extremely helpful in Transformation Advisor to generate deployment artifacts in the migration bundle, which we will explore later in the lab. Review the data collector command that is shown based on your selections. If you were going to run the command, there are a few additional things that need to happen. Replace the \\<WEBSPHERE_HOME_DIR> and \\<PROFILE_NAME> variables with the values from the WebSphere environment If the WebSphere environment is not connected to the VM where Transformation Advisor is running, then the data collector utility that was downloaded must be copied and unpacked to the WebSphere environment. 6.5.1 FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY: Simulation of running the Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility Important: This section is for illustrative purposes only. DO NOT RUN THE COMMANDS shown! If the WebSphere Application Server and Transformation Advisor has connectivity, the data collector could be run as follows. Example of the Data Collector utility command to start collect the deployed applications information on the WebSphere Application server. ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /opt/ibm/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 Type 1 to accept the license agreement and press Enter , as illustrated below The utility will start to collect application data. This process takes time to complete, depending on how many applications are deployed on the WebSphere Application server. When the collection utility completes, you will see the following message; \u201c Thank you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis.\u201d Your application data is collected, it is saved as a zip file \u201c AppSrv01.zip\u201d , named based on the WebSphere profile that was analyzed. In general, if your application server and the Transformation Advisor are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data will be automatically uploaded to Transformation Advisor for you to view the analysis results. Otherwise, you must manually upload the data to Transformation Advisor before you can view the results. 6.6 Upload the data collection into Transformation Advisor In this section, you will upload the data collection zip file \u201c AppSrv01.zip \u201d from the WebSphere environment for analysis. Typically, before you can upload the data collector zip files, you will need to download the appropriate data collector for your target environments operation environment, such as Linux, Windows, etc. Additionally, you would run the data collector in the target environment to collect the data for your applications. Then, you can import the collection data into Transformation Advisor for analysis. Tip: As noted in the previous section, the data collection steps have already been done, and the resulting AppSrv01.zip file is provided for you in the lab environment. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page in the web browser, click the \u201c Workload type \u201d link to go to the Recommendations page.

Home > ibmdemo > openshift-workshop-was > labs > Liberty > TA-labs > AppSrv01.zip d. The AppSrv01.zip data collection file is now ready to be uploaded. Click the Upload button to continue. Once the data collection has been uploaded to Transformation Advisor, you are redirected back to the TA Recommendations screen. Notice that the page shows \u201c All Java applications \u201d from the WebSphere Application Server profile named AppSrv01 . The following details are included in the workspace summary: Total Applications : The total number of applications in the workspace. Avg. cost per application : The average number of days of development effort required to migrate an application. Common Code : The total cost to migrate all the common code in the workspace to the target platform. Unique app code : The total cost to migrate all the unique app code (code that is not shared between applications) in the workspace to the target platform. Total cost : The total cost to migrate all the applications and common code in the workspace to the target platform. In the next section, you will use Transformation Advisor to view the application data analysis that was collected. 6.7 Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications In this section, you are going to use the Transformation Advisor UI to view the application data analysis results that was collected in the previous section. From the \u201c All Java applications\u201d page, you can see there was a total of 5 applications analyzed from the WAS server. When data is uploaded, Transformation Advisor automatically detects the host machine the data came from, meaning, where the WebSphere application server apps were running. TA creates a corresponding collection and adds the applications there. The collection name can be overridden when running the data collector or edited in the transformation Advisor UI after the data is uploaded. In this example, the default collection name is used: admin.ibm.demo , which is the host machine where the data came from. Click on the \u201c Collections \u201d drop-down icon and view the collection name: \u201c admin.ibm.demo \u201d Transformation advisor analyzes all the application code and common code that is shared across applications and provides an estimated total cost for migrating the apps and common code in the workspace. Total cost is the number of days of development cost to migrate that code to run on the selected migration target . In this example, WebSphere Liberty is the selected migration target. The Migration targets include: Open Liberty WebSphere Liberty WebSphere Traditional You can choose multiple migration targets and Transformation Advisor will provide the workspace total cost effort for each of the selected targets. This provides a high-level view of the scope of work to migrate all the applications in the collection to specific migration targets. Depending on the applications, you may find that the effort to migrate to Open Liberty requires more effort that migrating to WebSphere Liberty. This is because Open Liberty does not include all the Java EE API specifications that are included in WebSphere Liberty. Click on the Migration targets drop-down and select all three migration targets and notice the different development costs associated with migration all 5 applications in the workspace to the various migration target environments. Here you can see that moving the applications in the collection to WebSphere traditional requires zero development costs, meaning there is no code changes necessary. However, moving to WebSphere Liberty may require 2.5 days and Open Liberty may take 6 days of development time to update the application code to run on those target runtimes. The \u201c All Java applications\u201d page also shows the application summary analysis results for all the apps from the AppSrv01 profile for each of the selected migration targets. For each app / migration target combination, you can see these results: Java application Collection / Profile name Complexity Issues Common code files Application cost (in days) Migration plan The following details are included in the summary table (this is the per-application view): Application Name : The name of the EAR/WAR file found on the application server. Collection/Profile : Collection represents the hostname of the machine where the application resides. The profile represents the profile name in the application server where the application is installed. Complexity : Indicates how complex Transformation Advisor considers this application to be if you were to migrate it to the cloud. Issues : The number and severity of potential issues with the migration of the application. Common code files : The number of common code files this aplication uses. A file is considered common if it is from a Shared Library or is used by at least one other application. Application cost in days : Provides an estimate in days for the development effort to perform the migration for just this application. Cost estimates calculated by Transformation Advisor are high-level estimates only and may vary widely based on skills and other factors not considered by the tool. Migration plan : accelerator files generated by Transformation advisor to aide in building and deploying the selected application to the target runtime. Mod Resorts is one of the applications that we want to consider migration to Liberty. In this section you will review the analysis results for the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application and determine if it is a good candidate for migration to Open Liberty or WebSphere liberty. First, let\u2019s narrow the focus in Transformation Advisor to view only the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application. a. In the search bar, type modresorts which will narrow the application list to only the Mod Resorts application for all three migration targets In this example, if you want to move the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application to Open Liberty, the complexity level is Simple , which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to Open Liberty. The application has no dependency, does not have any common code or shared library files. It has two minor (informational level) issues. The estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required. Notice that the modresorts application is also simple to migrate to the WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere traditional migration targets. For this lab, you will focus on the modernization of moderesorts-1.0_war.ear to Open Liberty. Next, you will look at the analysis results for moderesorts-1_0_war.ear application in detail. Click the modresorts-1_0_war.ear link targeting Open Liberty to expand its analysis results. The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity rules section . The overall complexity for the application is simple , indicating that the application can be directly moved to Open Liberty without any code change. Scroll down to Complexity Rules section. You can see there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 0 days . This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating the application code, but does not encompass the full scope of a migration project that would include server configuration, testing, etc. Expand the Issues and details section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Technology Report link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. The Technology report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS. It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application. TIP: If the complexity of migrating to the target environment is \u201c Complex \u201d , it means that some APIs are not available in the target runtime and application will have to be rewritten to use different APIs. As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere editions. Go back to the Transformation Advisor browser tab and click the Analysis Report link. The Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window. This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level. a. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules. For the Mod Resorts application, there are two warning rules regarding the application configuration in Docker containers. b. Click the Show results link next to the warning rules. You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is, or potential issue may be. c. Click the Show rule help link. This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue. For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the Inventory Report link. The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships, and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application, and the Java package names in the jar files, which will help identify if the classes are the customers application code or 3 rd party code. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them. In the Inventory report, view the package names of the classes in the utility Jars a. Scroll down to view the Contained Archives section and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to modresorts-1.0.war b. Then scroll down to the Utility JAR files and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to Utility JAR files c. View the Archive names of the jar files and the packages used in the JAR files. This is a good way to determine if the code in the utility JARS include customer code or if they are 3 rd party jars like (org.pache*). Additionally, if the application migration complexity is SIMPLE, you may want to verify if the utility jars include any company packages that begin with org or other package names that are IGNORED by default in the Transformation Advisor data collector. It could be possible that application code was not analyzed due to package names that are ignored by the data collector From the analysis reports you reviewed above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Open Liberty, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for migrating to Open Liberty with minimal effort. 6.8 Overview of the Mod Resorts application From the insights gained from Transformation Advisor, you learned that the Mod Resorts is a simple EE application and is a good candidate for moving to Open Liberty and container-based clouds. For illustration purposes, in this short section, a few screen shots are captured to illustrate the Mod Resorts application. The Mod Resorts application home page is illustrated here: The user would select the destination of their travel Perhaps the user wants to go to PARIS, FRANCE. Mod Resorts shows the weather of the city. Continue to the next section of the lab where you are briefly introduced to Transformation Advisor\u2019s migration plan. The migration plan includes a migration bundle of generated deployment artifact that accelerate the deployment of the application to Liberty and container-based cloud deployment. 7. Explore the migration bundle for the Mod Resorts application Transformation Advisor display details about the migration bundle that it generated to accelerate the modernization of applications to Liberty or traditional WebSphere in containers and to OpenShift. The migration bundle includes diverse artifacts, depending on the needs of the application to accelerate the build and deployment of an application Docker image into OpenShift platform. The user can choose to create a migration bundle for either: binary project of an application (uploading a WAR/EAR file and its dependent libraries) source code project of an application, so that the application source files can be modernized and maintained Now, let\u2019s quickly explore the Migration Plan for the Mod Resorts application to see the artifacts that Transformation Advisor creates to expedite the app deployment to OpenShift Platform. Return to the \u201c All Java applications \u201d page in Transformation Advisor which displays the Java application summary list Ensure only the Open Liberty migration target is selected Click on the Migration plan link located next to the Mod Resorts application analysis for Open Liberty, which will display migration plan for modresorts for the Open Liberty target Select the Binary option in the migration plan. Using the Binary option requires that you upload the Mod Resorts application binary (WAR or EAR), which will be included in the migration bundle along with the deployment artifacts that Transformation Advisor generated. a. Select Manual upload option under the Application dependencies section. Here you will manually upload the Mod Resorts WAR file to the migration bundle. b. Click the \u201c Drag or add file\u201d link to add the md resorts WAR file to the migration bundle c. Navigate to: Home > ibmdemo > openshift-workshop-was > labs > Liberty > TA-labs > modresorts-1.0.war Scroll down to the Migration Files section of the migration plan. Notice the files that were generated by Transformation Advisor to accelerate build and deployment of the application to Liberty, containers, and OpenShift. To accelerate the application modernization, the artifacts produced by Transformation Advisor include: server.xml : the configuration for the Liberty server pom.xml : Build the application using Maven Application CR : Custom Resource for the application to be deployed to OpenShift via the Open Liberty Operator Dockerfile : Create the Docker image for the application The user will be able to choose to download the artifacts as a migration bundle or send the bundle contents into a Git repository . Click the Download bundle link to download the bundle of artifacts to the local filesystem on the Workstation VM. The modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip file will be downloaded to the /home/ibmdemo/Downloads directory Unzip the migration bundle artifacts to a new folder on the Workstation VM a. From a terminal window, run the following commands to unzip the migration bundle to a new directory named \" modresorts-bundle \": mkdir /home/ibmdemo/modresorts-bundle cd /home/ibmdemo/modresorts-bundle cp ~/Downloads/modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip ~/modresorts-bundle unzip ~/modresorts-bundle/modresorts10war_migrationBundle.zip ls View the server.xml file. DO NOT CHANGE THE FILE CONTENTS. The server.xml file in the migration bundle is the Liberty server configuration file generated by Transformation Advisor, configured for the modresorts application. gedit ~/modresorts-bundle/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml The Liberty features list include features that the application requires. mpMetrics feature is included, which provides a /metrics endpoint from which you can access all metrics that are emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications. Variables are used so that the values that are likely to be different between environments can easily be overridden by external configurations like environment variables or configMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes. Close the editor when you finish reviewing the file. DO NOT SAVE any changes to the contents. View the Dockerfile file. Do not change the file contents. The Dockerfile file in the migration bundle is used to build the container image for running the modresorts application on a Liberty runtime in a containerized environment such ads Docker, Kubernetes, or Red Hat OpenShift. The Dockerfile was generated by Transformation Advisor, configured for the building the modresorts application. gedit ~/modresorts-bundle/Dockerfile The Dockerfile is a two-stage Dockerfile. The first phase is the \u201c build-stage \u201d that creates a docker image for the modresorts application. The second stage uses the Open Liberty kernel container image and the build artifacts produced from the \u201cbuild-stage\u201d to build the modresorts container image with the modresorts application and configuration files for deploying to a container environment. Close the editor when you finish reviewing the file. DO NOT SAVE any changes to the contents. 8. Use Transformation Advisor deployment accelerators to deploy and run the Mod Resorts application on Open Liberty In this section, you will install Open Liberty, create a new Liberty server, and leverage the artifacts generated by Transformation Advisor to configure and run the Mod Resorts application on your new Open Liberty server. Tip: Open Liberty is installed from a zip archive file. For the lab, the Open Liberty zip archive has already been downloaded to the lab environment. To get started, you will create a new directory where you would like to install Open Liberty. Then unzip the archive. That\u2019s it, Open Liberty is installed. Install Open Liberty on the VM a. From a Terminal window, run the following commands to perform an archive installation of Open Liberty mkdir ~/Liberty cd ~/Liberty unzip ~/Student/labs/TA-labs/openliberty-javaee8-21.0.0.12.zip -d ~/Liberty b. Open Liberty is installed to the \\~/Liberty/wlp directory. Change to Open Liberty \u201c bin \u201d directory, which is where the Open Liberty binaries are located. cd wlp/bin Use the server command to create a new Open Liberty server named modresorts_server ./server create modresorts_server Use the server command to start the Open Liberty server named modresorts_server ./server start modresorts_server Open a new Terminal window and view the Open Liberty server log file named \u201cmessages.log\u201d tail -f ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server/logs/messages.log a. Look for the message that the modresorts server started successfully At this point you have an Open Liberty Server running with a defaultserver configuration. However, there are no applications installed(deployed). Next, you will copy the Open Liberty server configuration file that TA generated for the Mod Resorts application. Then you will copy the Mod Resorts binary (WAR) to the Open Liberty server, in which case the application will be deployed and started. Copy the server.xml file that Transformation Advisor, which includes the Open Liberty server configuration for the modresorts application a. Return to the Terminal window where you started the Open Liberty Server. b. Run the following command to copy the server.xml file to the modresorts_server configuration directory. cp ~/modresorts-bundle/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server c. In the Terminal window running the \u201c tail \u201d command on the Open Liberty log file, notice that the server is being updated to reflect the updates in the new server.xml file that we copied into the Liberty runtime configuration. Note: You will see messages that specific Liberty features being removed, and others being added, based on the new server.xml file that is loaded. Install the modresorts application to the Open Liberty server, using the WAR file that is included in the Transformation Advisor migration bundle. cp ~/modresorts-bundle/target/modresorts-1.0.war ~/Liberty/wlp/usr/servers/modresorts_server/apps The command above copied the modresorts application WAR file to the Open Liberty \u201c apps \u201d folder, which where the server.xml file is configured to run the application. In the Terminal window running the \u201c tail \u201d command on the Open Liberty log file, notice that the server is being updated to reflect the modresorts application being started. Run the modresorts application from the Chrome browser on the VM. The context root for the application is \u201c/resorts\u201d and is defined in the Open Liberty server.xml file. http://localhost:9080/resorts a. You may click the drop-down menu for \u201c WHERE TO ?\u201d and select a destination Tip! If the application does not respond when clicking on the \u201cWHERE TO?\u201d menu, increase the window size of the Chrome browser. This appears to be a glitch with the application or Chrome browser Stop the Open Liberty server a. Return to the Terminal window where you started the Open Liberty Server b. Run the following command to stop the server named modresorts_server ./server stop modresorts_server Use CTL-C to Stop the \u201c tail \u201d command in the 2 nd Terminal window 9. Use Transformation Advisor accelerators to run the Mod Resorts application on Open Liberty in containers In this section, you will use the Dockerfile to build a docker image and run the modresorts application in a local Docker container. The Dockerfile is a two-stage Dockerfile: - The first phase is the \u201c build-stage \u201d that creates a docker image for the modresorts application. - The second stage uses the Open Liberty kernel container image and the build artifacts produced from the \u201cbuild-stage\u201d to build the modresorts container image with the modresorts application and configuration files for deploying to a container environment. - **RUN features.sh** downloads the Open Liberty features that are defined in the server.xml file - **RUN configure.sh** installs the Open Liberty features into the Docker image. Build the Docker image that includes the modresorts application on Open Liberty a. From a Terminal window, change to the directory where the Transformation Advisor migration bundle is located. b. Run the Docker build command to build the image The name of the docker image will be modresorts:1.0, as specified by the -t (tag) parameter. The Dockerfile used is in the current directory, as specified by the training dot on the command cd ~/modresorts-bundle docker build --no-cache -t modresorts:1.0 . When complete, you will see that the Docker image was created and tagged as \u201c modresorts:1.0 \u201d c. List the Docker image and its tag. The name of the image is \u201c modresorts \u201d and is tagged as \u201c 1.0 \u201d docker images | grep modresorts Run the Docker image -d runs the docker command in detached mode -p maps the internal pot 9080 to an external port 9081 --name specifies the name for the docker container that gets spun up Modresorts:1.0 is the name of the docker image to use to spin up the new container docker run -d -p 9081:9080 --name modresorts modresorts:1.0 Verify the docker container is running docker ps | grep modresorts The \u201c docker ps \u201d command lists docker containers that are \u201crunning\u201d. Running \u201c docker ps -a \u201d lists all docker containers, including containers that are stopped. View the Open Liberty log in the \u201c modresorts \u201d container to verify the modresorts application was installed and is running docker logs modresorts Run the modresorts application from the Web Browser. The application is exposed on port: 9081 The application context root is: /resorts http://localhost:9081/resorts a. You may click the drop-down menu for \u201c WHERE TO ?\u201d and select a destination Tip! If the application does not respond when clicking on the \u201cWHERE TO?\u201d menu, increase the window size of the Chrome browser. This appears to be a glitch with the application in Chrome browser Stop and remove the docker container. Then check that the container has been removed, by using the \u201c docker ps -a\u201d command docker stop modresorts docker rm modresorts docker ps -a | grep modresorts Remove the modresorts docker image. Then use the \u201c docker images \u201d command to verify the image has been removed docker rmi modresorts:1.0 docker images | grep modresorts Summary In this lab, you learned how to evaluate the existing Java application using IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor. You learned how to use Transformation Advisors generated deployment accelerators from the migration bundle to build and run an application in Open Liberty in stand-alone mode on a VM and in containers. As a part of IBM Application Modernization solutions, the Transformation Advisor tool provides a recommendation for the right-fit IBM WebSphere Application Server edition and offers advice, best practices, and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or to WAS container, or to newer versions of WebSphere traditional.

From the \u201c All Java applications\u201d page, you can see there was a total of 5 applications analyzed from the WAS server. When data is uploaded, Transformation Advisor automatically detects the host machine the data came from, meaning, where the WebSphere application server apps were running. TA creates a corresponding collection and adds the applications there. The collection name can be overridden when running the data collector or edited in the transformation Advisor UI after the data is uploaded. In this example, the default collection name is used: admin.ibm.demo , which is the host machine where the data came from. Click on the \u201c Collections \u201d drop-down icon and view the collection name: \u201c admin.ibm.demo \u201d Transformation advisor analyzes all the application code and common code that is shared across applications and provides an estimated total cost for migrating the apps and common code in the workspace. Total cost is the number of days of development cost to migrate that code to run on the selected migration target . In this example, WebSphere Liberty is the selected migration target. The Migration targets include: Open Liberty WebSphere Liberty WebSphere Traditional You can choose multiple migration targets and Transformation Advisor will provide the workspace total cost effort for each of the selected targets. This provides a high-level view of the scope of work to migrate all the applications in the collection to specific migration targets. Depending on the applications, you may find that the effort to migrate to Open Liberty requires more effort that migrating to WebSphere Liberty. This is because Open Liberty does not include all the Java EE API specifications that are included in WebSphere Liberty. Click on the Migration targets drop-down and select all three migration targets and notice the different development costs associated with migration all 5 applications in the workspace to the various migration target environments. Here you can see that moving the applications in the collection to WebSphere traditional requires zero development costs, meaning there is no code changes necessary. However, moving to WebSphere Liberty may require 2.5 days and Open Liberty may take 6 days of development time to update the application code to run on those target runtimes. The \u201c All Java applications\u201d page also shows the application summary analysis results for all the apps from the AppSrv01 profile for each of the selected migration targets. For each app / migration target combination, you can see these results: Java application Collection / Profile name Complexity Issues Common code files Application cost (in days) Migration plan The following details are included in the summary table (this is the per-application view): Application Name : The name of the EAR/WAR file found on the application server. Collection/Profile : Collection represents the hostname of the machine where the application resides. The profile represents the profile name in the application server where the application is installed. Complexity : Indicates how complex Transformation Advisor considers this application to be if you were to migrate it to the cloud. Issues : The number and severity of potential issues with the migration of the application. Common code files : The number of common code files this aplication uses. A file is considered common if it is from a Shared Library or is used by at least one other application. Application cost in days : Provides an estimate in days for the development effort to perform the migration for just this application. Cost estimates calculated by Transformation Advisor are high-level estimates only and may vary widely based on skills and other factors not considered by the tool. Migration plan : accelerator files generated by Transformation advisor to aide in building and deploying the selected application to the target runtime. Mod Resorts is one of the applications that we want to consider migration to Liberty. In this section you will review the analysis results for the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application and determine if it is a good candidate for migration to Open Liberty or WebSphere liberty. First, let\u2019s narrow the focus in Transformation Advisor to view only the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application. a. In the search bar, type modresorts which will narrow the application list to only the Mod Resorts application for all three migration targets In this example, if you want to move the modresorts-1_0_war.ear application to Open Liberty, the complexity level is Simple , which indicates that the application code does not need to be changed before it can be moved to Open Liberty. The application has no dependency, does not have any common code or shared library files. It has two minor (informational level) issues. The estimated development effort is zero day because no code change is required. Notice that the modresorts application is also simple to migrate to the WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere traditional migration targets. For this lab, you will focus on the modernization of moderesorts-1.0_war.ear to Open Liberty. Next, you will look at the analysis results for moderesorts-1_0_war.ear application in detail. Click the modresorts-1_0_war.ear link targeting Open Liberty to expand its analysis results. The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the Complexity rules section . The overall complexity for the application is simple , indicating that the application can be directly moved to Open Liberty without any code change. Scroll down to Complexity Rules section. You can see there is no code change required and no development cost, the estimate migration over all develop cost is 0 days . This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements, which includes migrating the application code, but does not encompass the full scope of a migration project that would include server configuration, testing, etc. Expand the Issues and details section. You can see the only minor potential issue listed is on configuring the application in Docker container. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the Technology Report link, this opens a new browser window to show the application Evaluation Report. The Technology report lists all java technologies the application used and whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional for z/OS. It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is suitable for an application. TIP: If the complexity of migrating to the target environment is \u201c Complex \u201d , it means that some APIs are not available in the target runtime and application will have to be rewritten to use different APIs. As you can see from the report, the Mod Resorts application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere editions. Go back to the Transformation Advisor browser tab and click the Analysis Report link. The Detailed Migration Analysis Report opened in a new browser window. This is the deep-dive report which shows all issue found at the code level. a. Scroll down to Detailed Results by Rule section, you can see all the java technology issues identified based on different migration rules. For the Mod Resorts application, there are two warning rules regarding the application configuration in Docker containers. b. Click the Show results link next to the warning rules. You can see the detail analysis of the issue at code level, in a specific class file and specific line. This helps developers to pinpoint where the issue is, or potential issue may be. c. Click the Show rule help link. This expands the Rule Help section which provides recommended solutions on how to fix the issue. For the Docker container configuration issue, the utility provides best practice suggestion to externalize the configuration for the container. Go back to the Transformation Advisor page and click the Inventory Report link. The Inventory Report shows up. This report helps you examine what is in your application, including the number of modules, their relationships, and the technologies in those modules. It also gives you a view of all the utility JAR files in the application, and the Java package names in the jar files, which will help identify if the classes are the customers application code or 3 rd party code. Potential deployment problems and performance considerations are also included. a. Scroll down to view this report which serves as good decision-making tool to info you what is inside your application runtime, and to help you to have a better understanding of the application runtime, the components it has and the relationships among them. In the Inventory report, view the package names of the classes in the utility Jars a. Scroll down to view the Contained Archives section and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to modresorts-1.0.war b. Then scroll down to the Utility JAR files and click on the \u201c show details \u201d link next to Utility JAR files c. View the Archive names of the jar files and the packages used in the JAR files. This is a good way to determine if the code in the utility JARS include customer code or if they are 3 rd party jars like (org.pache*). Additionally, if the application migration complexity is SIMPLE, you may want to verify if the utility jars include any company packages that begin with org or other package names that are IGNORED by default in the Transformation Advisor data collector. It could be possible that application code was not analyzed due to package names that are ignored by the data collector From the analysis reports you reviewed above, you know that the Mod Resorts application is supported by Open Liberty, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration. You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for migrating to Open Liberty with minimal effort.","title":"6.7 Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications"},{"location":"lab-guides/md/lab5/Lab05-Evaluate-App-Using-Transformation-Advisor-v2.1/#68-overview-of-the-mod-resorts-application","text":"From the insights gained from Transformation Advisor, you learned that the Mod Resorts is a simple EE application and is a good candidate for moving to Open Liberty and container-based clouds.
