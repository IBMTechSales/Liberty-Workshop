Workshop Introduction This course introduces the student to Liberty. Students will learn basic Liberty concepts, archive installation, and working with Liberty in various development environments. At the end of this workshop, the student will learn how to install Liberty, understand Liberty concepts, use Liberty in common IDE's, Dev Mode, in containers, and from the command line. This course is geared toward developers and architects who are looking to understand fundamental to basic level on Liberty concepts and how to work with a Liberty environment. The Linux workshop environment is provided for workshop students. This is a hands-on workshop that contains the following exercises: Liberty archive installation and setup Getting started with Liberty with Liberty Tools in Eclipse IDE, and command line Using Liberty in Dev Mode via command line Using Liberty Tools in VS Code IDE Reserve lab environments Please follow the reserve environment instructions to reserve a lab environment, or schedule a workshop. The lab environment is configured with the tools you need to be able to complete the labs. Note: Workshop environments must be scheduled at least 3 Days prior to the delivery day of the workshop.

Note: Instructors will be authorized access to the Workshop Instructor Portal where attendee environments can be observed. b. Workshop Delivery Audience: Select Internal or External from the drop-down list. The field is required. c. Number of Environments: Enter the numeric value of the number of environments you want to have provisioned for the workshop. This value can be LESS than the number of actual attendees that join. An Auto-grow feature selection under the advanced settings can be used to automatically add environments as needed for the workshop in case you reach maximum environment limit. d. Number of Attendees: Enter the numeric value of the number of attendees you expect to have at the workshop. Workshops should have some specified limit of attendees, as not to overwhelm the instructors and result in less than favorable delivery and customer satisfaction of the workshop. e. Start Date / Time: Using the date and time widgets, enter the date, time, and Time zone that the workshop should be scheduled to start. This is the date and time that the automated scheduling system should have your environments available and ready. Personally, I specify 30 minutes to 60 minutes earlier than the actual start time of the workshop just in case there are technical difficulties. f. End Date / Time: Using the date and time widgets, enter the date, time, and Time zone that the workshop should be scheduled to end. This is the date and time that the automated scheduling system should shutdown your environments.

Under the Scheduling Information page, there are advanced settings that further shape when the environments should be deployed, removed, and grow. These advanced settings are optional. The workshop scheduler has default values for deploying and removing environments based on the workshop start / end times that you setup. Auto Stop Limit: This field specifies how long an environment must be idle before it either shuts down or suspends the environment. The default time is 180 minutes. Auto Stop Behavior: This field determines the action to take when an environment is idle for the duration specified in the Auto Stop Limit field. TIP: When the environment includes Redhat OpenShift, ALWAYS specify SHUTDOWN. OpenShift cannot routinely be resumed from a suspended state. Deploy On: This field can be used to specify the date and time for the scheduler to start deploying the environments. TIP: Specify approximately 2 hours prior to your workshop to provide sufficient time for the environments to start. Remove On: This field can be used to specify the date and time for the scheduler to remove the environments. TIP: Specify approximately 1 hour after your workshop is scheduled to end. Enable Auto Grow: Use this field to specify that you want the number of environments to increase if you reach the maximum number of environments that were deployed. The default value is NO Auto grow step size: When auto grow is triggered this filed determines how many environment should be added at a time. The default value is 1 . Auto grow max: Specify the maximum number of environments allowed. Example: If you specified 20 environments, and you want to be able to add 5 additional environments, then this value should be set to 25.
